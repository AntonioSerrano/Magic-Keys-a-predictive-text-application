Hi! My name is Antonio Serrano and I work as a professional data analyst in the private sector in Murcia, Spain. My current interests in the field include things like:
+ Learning machine
+ Optimization
+ Clasification analysis
+ Big Data
+ Artificial intelligence
+ Neuronal networks
+ Bayesian statistics
+ R and Python programming, of course ;)

In fact, I have two great passions in my life. The first one is spending time with my marvelous girlfriend. The second one is my PhD. In particular, I am doing my industrial PhD in this enthralling world of data science at <a href="http://international.ucam.edu/" target="_blank">UCAM university</a>.

Beyond that, I am passionate about
+ Computers
+ Tech news
+ Video games
+ Sci-fi movies
+ Tenis
+ Jogging
+ Tapas!!
