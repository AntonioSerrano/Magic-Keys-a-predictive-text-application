# Magic-Keys-a-predictive-text-application
This application was programmed to complete the Capstone Project in the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera in collaboration with Swiftkey. It is capable of scanning a stream of text as it is typed by a user and suggest possibilities for the next word to be appended to the input stream. It was developed using the Shiny library in R.
