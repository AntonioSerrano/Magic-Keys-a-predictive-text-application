Remember, the Hyde Park progressive took searing heat from lakefront liberals when she successfully pushed Joe Berrios over Forrest Claypool for Cook County assessor in 2010. Her rationale: Berrios is a veteran champion for minority access to jobs, contracts and clout. Claypool had never even been at the table.

Community volunteers are coordinated through Pacifica School Volunteers and many return each year. Laurie Frater, Jefferson Union High School District Trustee, noted, "this is one of my favorite days of the year. It is wonderful to see the learning that is taking place at Oceana." Allan Hale, a Korean War veteran and VFW commander, found Non's atomic bomb presentation particularly impressive. "I participate as an evaluator because I like to see the success of our students. I am very impressed with our education system and how it is working. And the teachers that work with students are so supportive and constructive." For science teacher Ryan Reidy, the highlight of Senior Exhibition is to see the growth of the students from early freshman days through senior year. "To watch someone progress from a shy and quiet student, to a confident and animated public speaker - that is the payback for doing what we do." Congratulations to all the courageous Oceana administrators, teachers and seniors. Friday, March 16, was an exhibition of excellence.
<U+201C>I wasn<U+2019>t expecting him to get under center.

To see him walk down and get up under center was kind of sneaky. And the offensive linemen, their splits were tight so it kind of gave it away.<U+201D>

The ruling, signed Wednesday, comes nearly two months after the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries investigators found substantial evidence the restaurant chain discriminated against its Thai workers. It did so, the agency said, partly by leveraging their special work visas to pay them less, work them longer and subject them to less favorable contract terms and working conditions than their non-Thai peers.
And she did learn, from many people, from many parts of Mexico. Wong Fillmore, a working linguist and retired UC Berkeley professor of education, estimates that she has made more than 75,000 tamales. And she has staged a tamalada, or tamale-making party, for 55 consecutive Christmas Eves. She became smitten with this traditional Mexican holiday feast when she was living in Gilroy teaching the children of migrant farmworkers.
Yes, yes, after seeing the pilot, the network wanted to ramp up the action. We had a little bit, but they wanted more, which is kind of ironic because the original script had a very elaborate car chase and I thought, 'Oh, that will be fun,' but by the time we began shooting, it was gone, of course, for budget reasons. But now we have another action sequence in the pilot, which I think is actually better. I hope you liked it. It's the one in the gas station <U+2014> it was fun.
Chris Molitor, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 73, said he had long heard something was coming from Slay's office but had not gotten anything official until last Thursday, when the mayor's operations director, Sam Dotson, told him to expect a letter this week requesting a meeting.

But although Weinstein might be pressing the issue to benefit his company, that doesn't render the issue invalid. An R rating covers an overly broad range of cinematic territory, from an extra couple of four-letter words to racy simulations of sex acts and full frontal nudity as well as persistent and extreme violence. Yet for all of these, the attendance rules are the same.
On Feb. 18, Egyptians again gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square, this time in a victory celebration, one week after their revolution unseated President Hosni Mubarak. Tunisians have also been sampling new freedoms of speech and press along a boulevard that is no longer a war zone. But even as the exultation lingers, women in both countries have launched new protests. They want to make sure that democracy does not erode their rights.

Authentic Neapolitan pizzas --whole and unsliced, with minimal toppings --are the stars. They arrive thin and chewy-crisp, a little sour and mottled with the essential bitter black spots that signal a dance with wood fire. Flavors can be jaw-dropping --perhaps smoky paprika salami mingled with the deep tang of Hungarian pickled peppers, or shiitake mushrooms and salty pancetta set off by a whole duck egg sitting at dead center.

A deal was cut. The cooperative would get permission to try the redemption centers on a bigger scale. Meanwhile, new beverages would be folded in but not until the redemption centers had a chance to take root. Lastly, the nickel would only increase to a dime if redemption rates fell. If the pilot works out, Andersen expects he'll be asking lawmakers to expand the program in a couple years.
For Jane Dryden Louis, author of the weekly letters, the assassination coincided with her growing awareness of the world outside her neighborhood. She remembers being drawn to the drama and pageantry of the Kennedys, and the tragedy as well. After the assassination, she set up an altar with candles in her bedroom, and she and her friends pretended to be Jacqueline, Teddy and Bobby Kennedy.
It was a quiet, sunny morning at Wolsfeld Woods in Medina last week, about 20 minutes west of Minneapolis. <U+00B6> Quiet except for a pileated woodpecker drumming on a wooded hillside, the whirring of crickets and tree frogs in a small wetland and the guttural exchange of two elegant white swans cruising across Wolsfeld Lake.

Cruise Card Control: Helps track bar tabs, fees for shore excursions, souvenir costs and other expenses. $1.99
Storr was broadsided with a total of $28 in mysterious fees. Like any good journalist, he investigated and found they were credit card fees levied directly by the airline. He says he feels as if the airline "helped itself" to more of his money even after quoting a lower fare through an online travel agency.
... We ran to the windows and saw that the streets were full of people, who looked like frenzied ants whose home had been stirred up with a stick. They were barefooted and in all stages of reckless dishabille, treading around on broken glass and brickbats, trying to find out what had hit them, and I never felt so small and helpless in my life as I did that morning when I gazed upon the stricken city.
A brief agreement with the Illinois State Police was derailed after a conflict arose because Hiram Grau, a high-ranking investigator under Alvarez, was named as head of the state police. Alvarez considered bringing in the FBI or a suburban police task force, but those ideas were rejected. Kirk said they also considered the option of just asking the chief judge for a special prosecutor at that point, but rejected it. The law says there needs to be an "actual conflict," not just the appearance of one, he said, and in their view there was no conflict at all.

The West Portal strip has plenty of grown-up attractions - in the form of friendly neighborhood pubs. And they all have quintessential bar names: The Dubliner, Joxer Daly's and perhaps best of all, the Philosopher's Club. The closest you'll get to mixology in West Portal is a gin and tonic. And in this case, that's a very good thing.
The French believe they have a right to pleasure and are highly tolerant of their fellow citizens' private behavior. They don't seem to mind that President Nicolas Sarkozy and his stunning pop star wife, Carla Bruni, have had affairs and they weren't too distressed when the culture minister wrote openly of patronizing young male prostitutes abroad. While Americans have "proved time and again that they see a politician's cheating in marriage as tantamount to cheating on the voters and the country," the French "do not enjoy ugly revelations that disturb the surface and threaten the social fabric," Sciolino writes. In fact, male politicians are expected to exude virility as proof that they are able to handle the job. President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was praised by even right-wing French politicians as a sign that he was a healthy male.

There are, of course, more films planned, but so far, the movie franchise doesn<U+2019>t deliver the fantastic imagery and moral parables of the <U+201C>Harry Potter<U+201D> series (or even the sexual power and cultural subtext of the <U+201C>Twilight<U+201D> saga).

The best thing about these West Coast games is that they're on TV every weeknight now. It keeps coming back to you, like the night shift, only this one you get to spend on your couch. Over a week of watching them, these games create sleep deprivation that calls into questions the provisions of the Geneva Convention. But when watched in moderation, they are special.

WASHINGTON -- Ohio's governor, attorney general and most state Republican elected officials have deep problems with the Affordable Care Act, especially its mandate that nearly all Americans must get health insurance by 2014. Ohio Democrats feel otherwise -- and at least 11 of them are expected to be signatories to a friend-of-the-court brief being filed today at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Lacking a support system doesn't mean he'd be a franchise quarterback with one. Improved? You'd certainly hope so. But it's not as if -- "presto" -- he goes from Eric Zeier to Drew Brees. If it were that simple, a lot more teams would be targeting undersized, third-rounders as the answer.
But all of Provence is rich in art of one kind or another. About two hours west of Nice, you will find the Musee Granet (www.museegranet-aixenprovence.fr) in Aix-en-Provence, where Picasso lived with his wife Jacqueline Roque and her daughter, practically in Cezanne's backyard. The museum's permanent collection includes works by both artists, as well as pieces by Giacometti, Leger and Mondrian. In the basement is the d'Entremont, an archaeological site where you will find Celtic-Ligurian sculptures.

Among the services JetBlue added to get more business travelers was its Even More Legroom seats, since the airline doesn't offer business or first class. It recently tacked on an Even More Speed option, which allows those customers that buy the roomier seats a chance to jump lines.

(On if the West Coast offense looks he wants it to and where he would want it to go)- "There's room for improvement. I think part of that had to do with the offseason not being able to use it. I think some of the things we do are okay. Are we all a little frustrated by our offense right now? Yeah, I think so, but am I surprised? No, it did take some time to really time this thing out. As I mentioned earlier, because we're young I suspect as the season goes along and every time they get one more game under their belt, one more game under their belt, listen to this, practice this, same plays and all that, that you should see a little bit more of an offense with a little more timing, a little more fluidness to it. You've seen this system work before and it works. It just takes some time to get on the same page. I think we were hurt just a little bit by what happened in the offseason, like a lot of teams. You can see it every once in a while out there."

When it comes to the different understandings of atonement embraced by our church, we can journey with each of them in prayer and worship without feeling ourselves torn asunder or compromised by their different emphases. It is possible to see in them all the same basic premise: that "earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God" (as the Exsultet puts it!). Bickering over and then deciding finally exactly how that happens is less important than standing firm in our awed confession that in fact it has happened and is continuing to happen. The Anglican tradition rejoices in the great mysteries of our faith, not using "mystery" as an excuse for ignorance or indecision, but recognizing that all of our attempts to explain how God does what God does are going to be partial and incomplete.

Pippa Middleton media frenzy: When Prince William and Kate Middleton got hitched, the lovely sister of the bride (who rocked her curve-skimming maid of honor dress) got the attention she deserved. Then came the Pippa photo spreads about her wardrobe choices. And the who's-Pippa-dating stories.

This isn't about having a bunch of bad guys in office who are incapable of doing the right thing by us. I suspect a good many are not only capable, but have the best of intentions. Certainly the pressures of a downturned economy haven't helped slow the desire for a development juggernaut to race through our county. It puts them in a tough spot. But we want to be smart about how we grow and an unwillingness to consider dissenting voices isn't smart.

Inhale the fragrance of pho, beef broth stocked with sirloin, brisket and meatballs. Noodles like rice vermicelli with marinated pork and sausage go where other noodles rarely go. And the scent from crispy lemongrass chicken is as alluring as Chanel No. 5.

Overall, Hulu is a big improvement over rivals such as Joost, which requires you to download a player that plants itself on your desktop and keeps jabbing you in the ribs with annoying pop-ups and invitations to share content with your friends. When I was settling down to watch an episode of the old ABC drama "Twin Peaks" and tried to remove a Joost pop-up for a credit-card company, I instead got kicked immediately into a commercial for the same advertiser. Not fun.

Casa de Mi Padre is at its best (a relative term, mind you) when it's at its silliest and most surreal: the appearance of a mystical white mountain lion, who offers Ferrell's Armando sage counsel - and who is one of the least convincing animatronic puppets to come down the pike since comedian Soupy Sales conversed with White Fang - provides sublime guffaws. So, too, does a trippy dream sequence, with dolls, puppets, strobes, and a David Lynchian tableau.

Ray Ratto, CBSSports.com: "When more money is distributed to fewer schools, as a playoff system would essentially ensure, who benefits from that power surge? The same people who have most of it already. And who will keep that power in check? Who will ensure players get more freedom and a greater chance to pursue whatever academic dreams they might in fact have? Who will be in charge of transfer policies that of late have reminded us just how restrictive and unfair the current system is? That's the stuff we ought to be chasing first. The stuff that matters not to our viewing enjoyment, but to the betterment of the young people who provide it. You see, the BCS isn't the worst thing to come down the pike in the history of college athletics. The NCAA rulebook is worse.

Do you see any thematic connection between your work in documentaries and your work in fiction films? In all my films, I'm interested in larger-than-life characters.

The glaring absence in both of those lines is the homers. Berkman has yet to hit his first homer of the season, but he's missed a couple weeks with injuries. Pujols has yet to hit his first home run as an Angel, but he's been dealing with the marine layer and that real oppressive fog of mega-contract expectations. Or his balance is off. Or whatever. Craig has the ability to change that number for the Cardinals.

The airport checkpoint as we know it today sprang into existence in spring 2002, over a month and a half at Baltimore/Washington International airport. New demands on the system after 9/11, like an exhaustive manual check of all carry-on bags, had left checkpoints overwhelmed by long lines and backlogs. A team of management consultants from Accenture delved into the minutiae of checkpoint activity at BWI: How long did it take to pass from one point to another? How did the behavior of travelers affect line speed? How were people interacting with the equipment?

Signs of movement toward renewed cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have Israeli officials on edge. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organization committed to its destruction and has shunned negotiations. In the wake of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' efforts last fall to sidestep negotiations with Israel and seek United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state, it is easy to see this as another ominous sign for the prospects for peace. But there is another possibility at work. If Mr. Abbas can capitalize on the regional developments in political Islam sparked by the Arab Spring and exert a moderating influence on Hamas' extremism, he could do much more to realize his goals than he ever could have achieved through his end-run to the UN.

The aquarium life-support system can be run remotely for hours on end -- with a laptop and a good Wi-Fi connection, McDill and his colleagues can monitor 10,000 data points -- but you can't beat the value of a stroll around the property.

A: For us, when we started, we could get a five- to 15-week run in a city. That just doesn't happen to anybody anymore, even if the movie's doing really, really well and gets great reviews, and things like that.

Economics change all the time, so it's not surprising. But there's not really an independent-movie business anymore.

Yuan and his four friends cheered.
Walker's opponents insist the remarks undermine the Republican governor's long-held claim that the polarizing law he and the GOP-led Legislature pushed through stripping most public workers of nearly all their collective bargaining rights was meant solely as a budget-balancing measure. They also say the comments signal Walker ultimately means to go after private sector unions by making Wisconsin a right-to-work state, which would allow workers to not pay dues even if they are covered by a union contract.
"The Free Syrian Army stopped shooting, but the regime's army has not stopped shooting," an activist named Moaz said. "When the security forces stop shooting <U+2026> it will go back to being a peaceful revolution."

Just as people have grown understandably indisposed toward anything political, Clooney directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in the election drama "The Ides of March." Rather than play the candidate any number of people wish he were (Clooney says he's not interested in actually running for office), the actor's "Ides of March" presidential contender is about as honorable as John Edwards. And while starring in an Alexander Payne movie might initially appear risk-free, the film's cuckolded protagonist is not necessarily the type of character Clooney's peers would fight to play, and it proved to be a part Clooney said concerned him no end. "I was terrified from the moment it started," he says.

Looking over that list, it's clear that there are few consensus players who emerge as the clear choice for any defensive awards. Buehrle, the St. Charles native, is one. Gardner sure appears like he should get some run as the best defensive left fielder -- which is a little like saying the left fielder who should be playing center. Jackson stands out as perhaps the best center fielder in the majors. (Aside: Bourjos was second in the majors to Jackson with a plus-24.)

Soils and topography are deep and diverse. The barriers make Chile virtually free of pests.

The survey results confirm what area players have known since the place went public in 1963: Sleepy ranks as one of the best challenges in the area. It is demanding but fair. You will find plenty of trouble if you are not accurate, from the many deep ravines to the 58 bunkers that strategically dot the course. Reaching many of the greens offers little solace because of steep contours. There are few flat putting surfaces. The course is a classic "out and in" design, with the opening holes on both nines playing downhill and with the wind and the incoming holes playing uphill and into the wind. The fairways are narrow and the Cleveland Metroparks woods lurk as stealers of errant shots.

-Limits on Half Dome Trail: Park officials want to limit the number of people who can access the popular 8-mile Half Dome Trail. Among the options being considered is removing the steel cables that make the final portion of the climb easier for less-experienced hikers. Another option is to limit access to 300 people per day. That's fewer than the 400 allowed per day between Memorial Day and October under a park lottery in 2011. Half Dome looms 5,000 feet above the valley floor. Five people have died on the trail since 2006.

The Billikens, like the Badgers, employ multiple half-court sets, rely on a point guard to orchestrate them and, if everything goes according to plan, milk some 30 seconds off the 35-second shot clock. It is no accident that Saint Louis held No. 8 seed Memphis to 54 points Friday in the Billikens' opening round game. That is exactly 20 points less than Memphis averaged per game this season.
Over there, they fought on the same side. Back here, they are on opposite sides. That's because Tommy (Chris Kerson) is pulled back into service for a crime lord engaged in a turf war with the drug-dealer brother of Darren (Will Blagrove). Their reentry proves to be as lethal as the worst days of their deployment. Legitimate job opportunities are scarcer than a playground with a hoop and net.
As workers beef up their personal networks, they are avoiding taking personal risks in the workplace. And so are their employers.

In 2005, Ford shifted all Escape and Mariner production to Kansas City and closed its Lorain Assembly Plant, a facility that had made several cars for Ford since its opening in 1958 and had made the Econoline and parts for the vans since the early 1960s. The automaker consolidated all commercial van production to Avon Lake, another move that was supposed to guarantee a solid future.
"Dude, look," says one of three officers who approach Hammond. "Go put on pants, or we're going to take you to jail. There's a city code that says you can't be naked in public. There are kids out here. You can't be riding around with your penis hanging out, OK? ..."

The tortillas were so stale they tasted as if they had been left out in the fog for about three days. The chunky salsa consisted of huge irregular dicesof white onions, mushy tomatoes and a soupy broth.
Brayan Pena led off the inning with a double. The Royals were up 4-2 and decided to play for a tack-on run. Mitch Maier was at the plate and attempted a sacrifice bunt to move Brayan to third. Mitch got the bunt down, but Brayan did not advance. Once again, without talking to someone I can't tell you why, but I can make an educated guess.

After more than 12 years as a trial court and court of appeals judge, and more years than that being tangentially involved with judicial issues as an attorney, I firmly believe that all seven justices on our state Supreme Court -- including those up for election this year, Justices Stephen Markman and Brian Zahra -- are experienced, principled individuals with stellar reputations. Although they may disagree on many important cases, those disagreements result from differing legal views, not from who is before the court.
In at least one past instance, the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for an attack it played no role in. Mehsud reportedly said his men were behind a mass shooting in March 2009 at the American Civic Association in Binghamton, N.Y., in April 2009. That claim turned out to be false.

"We all respect each other so much," he said. "We all know how hard it is. It really surprised me that guys would want to try to intentionally hurt somebody. This is a fraternity. There's so few of us that do it. The average life expectancy is three years in the NFL or something like that.
Yes, we're told, the administration is courting potential successors and, yes, we're moving forward. But we'd rather not talk about it. There's even an indication that one suitor is talking about running the race as a non-profit enterprise, a non-polluting Green Grand Prix. What utter nonsense. The apparent deadline to begin organizing a new race is March. I hope it passes without having been met relieving the taxpayers of another burden about which they weren't even consulted.

Chandler has made the most of his time with the Zhejiang Lions, embracing the stint as "a lifetime experience." The Lions are willing to let Chandler return to the U.S. before they start playing in the playoffs, ESPN's Marc Stein reports.
I suggest the "thumpers" check more the "literal Bible" they profess to know so much about. At times, the early church at Rome may have presumed things about "their" God that were not that helpful, perhaps believing they had superior knowledge of the creator than those of other places. St. Paul had to call them to task as he wrote in his letter to them "Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways. For who has known the mind of the Lord?"

"The time in between such a big emotionally and physical meet such as the trials and another is much smaller (than before the 2004 and 2008 Olympics). I think it'll work out for the U.S. team.

Those worries will be hashed out by lawyers, in a courtroom, quite possibly behind closed doors. Attorneys for all the sides in the case - Dowdy, Hammons, his friends - asked that the case file be sealed to keep Hammons' personal finances and medical situation from the public glare. The only objection came from local media outlets, who said court records should be open for Hammons as they are for anyone else. After a hearing Friday, the judge sealed the records.

First, I say to the people of New Jersey, while the economic hour is dark, there are brighter days ahead. We have the tools to win the battle for a better future. More than our forefathers did ; even more than we realize ourselves.
The whole point of becoming self sufficient in energy <U+2014> as well as importing crude from friendly Canada <U+2014> is to become indifferent to crude purchased from countries that want to destroy us. Oil prices are set by global demand. If we produced additional crude so that global productive capacity is in excess of demand, world crude prices would fall, and as Mr Corredoira correctly observes, OPEC would be forced to cut production to maintain prices. However, OPEC members are not all equals in terms of production and population. Countries such as Nigeria cannot cut production because they have an immediate need for cash.
You can tell yourself it wasn<U+2019>t supposed to be this way. But Levert refuses to play that game.

About 1.5 million, or 53.6%, of bachelor's degree holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed, the highest share in at least 11 years, according to government statistics and analysis by university researchers. In 2000, the share was at a low of 41%, before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and IT fields. Out of the 1.5 million who struggled in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year, the AP study found.
Brad German, a Freddie Mac spokesperson in Virginia, said the organization will provide consistent reviews of lenders and will rank them monthly based on that performance.

Goodell called what the Saints did "particularly unusual and egregious" and "totally unacceptable."
"Femme Fatale," her new album, is an intermittently winning collection of sleek synth-pop, as streamlined and aerodynamic as a freshly minted luxury automobile. It is also the end stage of Spears<U+2019> detachment, and self-effacement: She wrote none of the songs on the album, contributed next to nothing to their production, and allowed her voice to be digitally manipulated to the point of unrecognizability.

Hospitality takes practice, and it has consequences. In my own tradition, the Eucharist is a place where we both learn and practice hospitality. God welcomes us to a feast that he provides with his own flesh and blood, and through it He offers us an ongoing opportunity to be wholly transformed. When Eucharistic hospitality becomes a habit, we start asking questions of ourselves and of the world in which we live. We remember that the church is not ours, but God's, and act accordingly. We begin to ask if our public policies, both foreign and domestic, reflect our value of hospitality. We seek active ways to make our hearts and homes places of gracious welcome, even at the risk of being made uncomfortable, or being asked to change.

Meanwhile, major oil producers like Saudi Arabia already have cranked up production to make up for lost Libyan oil. While this increases the flow of oil right now, it also cuts off spare production that could have been tapped later this year to meet increasing world demand. Spare production capacity, which was thought to be around 5 million barrels per day earlier this year, has since dropped to about 3 million barrels, Unnikrishnan said.
SECAUCUS <U+2014> One of the jurors who voted this week to convict former Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell of bribery says he is upset over delivering a verdict he didn<U+2019>t believe in, one he now hopes will be overturned on appeal.
He readily concedes that substance abuse and addiction are devastating. He ticks off his own examples: His father and a son have alcohol problems, his daughter was treated for heroin addiction and his brother died at 40 from alcoholism. His own junk food addiction caused him to balloon to 380 pounds before he had stomach surgery, changed his habits and got down to 200 pounds.
Andrew Luck, Stanford, 6-4, 234: Luck is a complete prospect with experience, a history of production, a feel for the game, size, athleticism, top intangibles and toughness. He doesn't have an arm like John Elway's, but it's good enough <U+2014> similar to Manning's, and he throws as accurately. His movement skills are similar to Jay Cutler's and he can throw on the run. He can take a hit like Cutler. Luck has shown he can work through his progressions and find second and third options. He has produced for four years and is considered NFL-ready. There is very little chance Luck will be a bust, and an excellent chance he will be a Pro Bowl caliber player.
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. <U+2014> So the Mets finally get some financial relief, you may think, and they celebrate by investing in a guy who has never posted a major league ERA under 4.20 or thrown more than 173 2/3 innings in a season?

Red Onion is Dang Boonyakamol's third explosion in the Portland area -- first at Cha Ba Thai on Sandy Boulevard several years ago, and until recently, at the impressive Dang's Thai Kitchen in Lake Oswego. Dang's greatest strength is working with textures, making them turn out the way they should and setting different ones against each other in the same dish. His crispy dishes are seriously crispy -- a specialty dating back to Cha Ba -- and in the most crowded, chili-laced stir-fries, his meats never turn into casserole casualties, keeping their tenderness and their identity. Sure, he can do a chicken with green curry, but the dishes you haven't seen in lots of other places are more interesting.

The title story features a different sort of fracture, as a girl uses her father's binoculars to spy on the people next door. Only at the end of the story, after a tragedy she didn't witness, does she realize that she has never known her neighbors at all. Even memory is conditional; in "Chance," an adult narrator looks back at the year she was 15, when her parents hosted a Torah study group that was a cover for a weekly poker game. "Did it happen exactly that way?" she asks halfway through the story. "A deck of cards has fifty-two factorial permutations. <U+2026> Fifty-two factorial is an enormous number. Roughly that many angels dance on any pin. Furthermore, two decades have passed since the night the rabbi's three nines (missing the spade) beat my mother's three fives (missing the diamond) in the first game of the weekly group. I would be wise to distrust my memory."

"It's a hard job. I get it. I'm trying to do the best I can," Holliday said. "When it's the third strike, that's the one that hurts. When it's the first or second strike you've still got a chance to overcome calls that are borderline or off."
No one would argue that preventing voter fraud isn't an important task for state government and that laws against it that are already on the books shouldn't be vigorously enforced. But given the risk of disenfranchising tens of thousands of legitimate Maryland voters as the cost for uncovering a minuscule number of fraudulent ballots, lawmakers of both parties ought to be wary of measures purporting to address a problem in the body politic for which the cure is certain to be worse than the disease.

<U+00F8>While unraveling the mystery behind Silent Hill - and figuring out why Pendleton was the one destined to perform the task - fans of the franchise will appreciate some new features. Environments are now much larger - so you don't feel like you're kept on a tight leash - and there are more side missions to take on, new characters to interact with and some moral choices to make. Puzzles are some of the best in the series, including a memorable sequence involving a Hansel and Gretel stage play, and music still plays a significant part of the interactive experience.

Are these Blazers too nice to win a series? Too polite? Too many good guys to win big? I keep thinking about that. And watching the Mavericks throttle them in the paint in Game 5 made me think about former Blazers power forward Maurice Lucas, and also, the Blazers teams of the late 1990s.

The bill died in committee.

Edna O'Brien, the distinguished Irish writer, is Byron's latest biographer, and she defines "Byronic" as denoting "excess, diabolical deeds and rebelliousness." It also connotes a certain impetuous and passionate intensity, which isn't a bad description of the spirit that animates O'Brien's own work. The fascination she finds in that implicit kinship is one of the things that makes "Byron in Love: A Short Daring Life" such a pleasure to read. This is a book not only for those who value perceptive, independent intelligence, but also for those who treasure lovely writing for its own sake. At this stage in her long career -- and who can believe that O'Brien is now in her 79th year? -- this is an author who seems incapable of composing a clumsy or uninteresting sentence.

Digging a ditch between lawn and flower bed is another method employed by many renowned gardeners here and in England. The general consensus among American gardeners is that if the English do it, it must be acceptable. But has anyone really considered what an unattractive practice this is?

Either fill the ditch with same mulch, or better yet, find another method of edging.

Escobedo's story, which traveled across the nation, is now well-known. In her first ever high school game, she struck out 17 in a no-hit win. She ended that freshman season with what is believed as the state single-season record with 501 strikeouts, a state championship and Player of the Year honors. As a sophomore, she faced the touring 2008 US Olympic softball team and struck out four batters, including its top hitter Jessica Mendoza. As a junior, she increased her single-season best of no hitters to 13 and perfect games to 2. Then followed it up with a stellar senior season as her pitches topped at 71 mph, though it didn't end the way it seemed destined to.
U.S. District Judge Kate O'Malley granted the request.
Hand it to Tom Cruise: Even on the cusp of 50, he still does his own stunts, looks studly in a suit and has perfect hair.

<U+25C6> Andrew Luck is considered the best quarterback prospect since Peyton Manning, but he has a long way to go to live up to that, if for no other reason than he's inheriting a worse supporting cast.

Vlass recovers the nose, and now the morphing begins. The process usually takes 40 minutes to an hour. White greasepaint goes around his mouth and eyes; fleshy rouge covers the rest of his face; a red smile stretches across his lips and sweeps up above the corners of his mouth.

Steeling myself for the big one, I browsed the stands, sampling crickets (bland and crunchy) and locusts (meaty and the legs stick between the teeth) before buying a bag of tarantulas. Shutting my eyes, I dipped my hand in the bag, pulled off a leg and nibbled. Surprisingly, once the initial revulsion wore off, the taste was not so bad. The texture of the a-ping was rough and crispy like a pork crackling, but inside it was tender and fatty and tasted a bit like cod.
The studied vagueness of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government also indicates that it seeks to avoid the mistake of announcing a goal that it might not be able to accomplish, as it did in 2006 when it proclaimed that it would destroy Hezbollah after the Lebanon-based terrorist group launched a cross-border attack and killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two. Although Israel inflicted major losses, it was unable to destroy Hezbollah as an organization, which fed perceptions that the latter had won a political victory.
Still, he said, he didn<U+2019>t return the cash to his longtime friend Ronald Manzo at any point during the six days between July 17 and July 23, 2009, when Elwell was arrested. The reason, he said, was Manzo "told me he was down the Shore and he would call me as soon as he got back."
A delay is about the big picture - giving aldermen and others time to properly nail down an idea that looks pretty good. For the sake of taxpayers, for the sake of the decaying city infrastructure the Trust promises to rebuild, let's take the time to get this right.

"He had no command," Rice coach Wayne Graham said. "He had no command of the breaking ball at all. I think they're a pretty a good fastball hitting team. They did a good job of hitting. You have to have two pitches in college baseball. You can't win with one unless you throw it 112 miles per hour."

Yet the majority of people have kids of their own. I suppose some of this majority are delusional or careless, but most just do the math and decide that having kids is worth a few (or few years) of these scenes. You need to figure out why your math is different.

Five days after the escape, a Corrections team scoured Kingman to determine what security flaws led to the escape. Their scathing assessment, described in an internal Corrections memo, listed the broken alarm, eight burned-out perimeter lights, other broken security equipment, and a lax, high-turnover culture in which MTC's green, undertrained staff and rookie supervisors ignored alarms, left long gaps between patrols of the perimeter, left doors leading out of some buildings open and unwatched, didn't alert the state or local police until hours after the escape, and failed in all manner of basic security practices.

To sustain its economic future, a country needs reasonable taxes, an affordable public sector and an economic climate conducive to job creation. This is not exactly a blinding revelation in the United States or much of Europe, which has seen painful encounters with economic reality in Italy, Greece and Spain. But in France, it seems to be a well-kept secret.
Since Sparks took the top job a year ago, he and his executive team have refocused the Southlake, Texas, company on hotel products, build-your-own-vacation packages and mobile devices.

So it surprised Tammy as she taught Makenzie those same fifth-grade health lessons, because Makenzie didn't seem concerned at all. Only later did Tammy realize that was because in Makenzie's mind, none of that would happen to her.
Hart is the varsity team's starting quarterback, a position Baker learned for the first time last fall. Since he wears size 13 1/2 shoes and is still so young, Baker figures to end up 6-2 or taller. And with his athleticism, he might continue to play football. But there should be no doubt about where baseball fits in.
It's also about perspective.

But attitudes are shifting, and there is a growing acceptance of same-sex unions. In the past year, almost every major poll has shown that a slim majority now supports them as a right. That overall support, however, masked a deep partisan divide. Democrats overwhelmingly supported gay marriage, by 64 to 32 percent, and independents by a narrower 54 to 42 percent. Republicans opposed it, by 57 to 39 percent.

The Department of Transportation's new rule, which goes into effect April 29, orders airlines to let passengers off planes delayed for three hours or face hefty fines. In December there were 22 flights nationwide that were delayed for more than three hours from gate to departure. The new DOT rule could slap an airline with a fine of $27,500 per passenger for that kind of delay. For an average Boeing 737 with a full load of passengers, the fine could be around $3.5 million.

It's a laudable victory. But with county funding approval still pending (a proposed "percent-for-art" ordinance would allocate 1% of new public or private construction costs to public-arts programming), it probably will be several years before its effects on cultural tourism, including an arts-marketing campaign aimed at tourists, are seen.

During a question-and-answer portion of a conference call this morning, ACC commissioner John Swofford was asked about Rutgers. He said, "I don't think it would appropriate for me to go there." That could mean a couple of things: first, the ACC still has visions of Texas running through it's head, which would result in Texas Tech coming as well; or second, the ACC already has that in the works.
The League is correct that controlling greenhouse gas emissions is a vital public health issue, one well worth fighting for. Postponing the EPA's authority would have perpetuated the overall problem, though scientists are split on whether the specific rules at issue in the Senate vote will help asthma sufferers.

3. Mammograms -- This is a diagnostic tool in which x-rays are taken of your breast to reveal abnormal tissues. Mammograms can detect small breast tumors in two ways: Early breast cancers often leave tiny calcium deposits in the breast as cells die, and these can be seen on the mammograms. Other breast tumors are revealed by showing masses or shadows that look like white spots on an otherwise dark breast image. Either way, these mammogram changes can be the first signal that there may be abnormal cells developing in the breast.

But there's a catch: Adams expected the ramp to someday accommodate a streetcar line traveling across the bridge. Eliminating the ramp means the proposed streetcar to Lake Oswego would need to travel through the westside intersection, not under it. Currently, there is no proposal to take the line over the Willamette, but making the bridge streetcar-ready is something Adams has linked to the city's $100 million contribution.

Those of us who provide health know that if patients are unable to access care in a clinic or non-hospital setting, some of them will seek care when their illness is much more expensive to treat such as when they are in crisis or, in the case of mental illness, when their behavior intersects with law enforcement. Providing care in the ER or when a patient is in crisis is dramatically more expensive.

The suddenness of the bike lane funding decision and the fact it occurred outside of the city's established budget process -- without citizen involvement -- is another concern. Sound budget decisions for Portland's water and sewer utilities can only occur with a long-term view of the system's needs. Consequently, both utilities routinely update five-year forecasts of operating and capital requirements and the rate increases necessary to fund them. Current five-year financial plans forecast annual rate increases substantially higher than the rate of inflation. For ratepayers to accept forecast rates and support annual budgets for the water and sewer systems, the city needs to ensure that budget decisions are made in the open and reflect highest priorities.
"I know that a lot of people from the outside see all the horrible stuff that happened, and that's all they see," she said. "Being here in State College, we got to be a part of it.

2009 Skinner El Dorado Grenache ($26, 15%): Winemaker Chris Pittenger's early vintages have quickly brought attention to this new foothills label. The Grenache hails from two notable sites, Sumu Kaw and Fenaughty, at 2,500 and 2,850 feet, and its big, warm profile is packed with mineral and clove-spiced strawberry, with a slight tarry side. For its relative weight and tannic heft, it's masterfully refined, a mix that the best Grenache can achieve.

This sad, pathetic excuse of a leader continues daily to show just how weak he is, but the media make it a circus, like this pronouncement is something new. Had a conservative president done something similar, he would have been vilified for his lack of integrity on a key issue at the core of a belief system, and then ridiculed as lacking in leadership. But simply because the self-anointed messiah says something, it must be deep, profound and worth everyone's time and energy.

North County has significantly higher rates of cancer and chronic diseases compared to the rest of the county and the state, according to a 2011 assessment sponsored by the county health department. The disparities are largely attributed to socioeconomic factors, although the report notes that "there are possibly some environmental issues within St. Louis County with legacy industries, but it is difficult to link pollutants from this source to any particular population. In any case, an almost insignificant amount of cancer is attributed to environment hazards today."

The first, he says, took place in 1864 with the arrival of the railroads, when Alameda was little more than a backwater still connected to Oakland.

The first scientific study of suicide was published in 1897 by French sociologist Emile Durkheim. He was convinced that growing suicide rates could not be attributed to mental illness alone.

The fascination with all things mobile is easily linked to traveling circuses, retro films such as "The Long, Long Trailer" starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the neighborhood ice cream truck decked with stickers for tasty sweet treats from drumsticks to Cool-a-Coo's, and the proverbial cross-country family road trip through the Grand Canyon aboard the tricked-out Winnebago or Volkswagen van.

The "Max" of the title is Maxim Waratt, the composer of the evening's score and an alias for the choreographer himself. The music is of the breathy, rumbling "plinky-plonky" bed-of-sound variety, and unfortunately doesn't add much to the substance of the piece. On the upside, it puts the focus squarely on the five men and five women.

The career trajectory of Hollywood directors before the '70s typically followed the winding path from unpretentious to "prestigious" (i.e., Oscar-worthy). Take, for example, George Stevens, who went from "Alice Adams," "Swing Time," "Gunga Din" and "The More the Merrier" to "A Place in the Sun," "Giant," "The Diary of Anne Frank" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Most of the '70s directors did their best to avoid this syndrome or at least held out for as long as they could. Coppola's "Apocalypse Now," a deranged movie about a deranged war, could never have been mistaken for a respectable war epic. Scorsese's biblical movie was "The Last Temptation of Christ."
Handicappers are eager to watch this vote for signs of contemporary bias. Carpenter has been a part of two World Series championship teams, and while he's set to open this season on the DL the afterglow of his October run is still shining -- and could tilt this vote.

It goes on - in that 100-percent-right- v.-100-percent-wrong mindset that passes for thinking among zealots - to castigate everything that NATO ever did or tried to do, including its involvement in the Yugoslav war which, rather than being a tardy response to genocide, the standard criticism, only made things worse, right up to its recent intervention in Libya's "NATO-enabled civil war."

Except for when he's hugging it out with first-round draft choices at Radio City Music Hall, commissioner Roger Goodell plays the head disciplinarian role quite convincingly. He was the Hanging Judge even before the Saints made it so easy for him, first by ignoring a warning, then by players taking ownership of fund raising for the program and by Gregg Williams instructing players on specific body parts to target.
Wessel says she got into the business by accident. She and her then-husband were working for a manufacturer's representative and bought that company in 1978 along with an affiliated distributor business.

Perhaps the same thing could happen for other parts of the crab. If restaurants began using the rest of the crab, Maryland processors would supply it and have a better chance of competing against their big-lump competitors. And in the end, Maryland diners would be eating better crab dishes.
"Last year I was offered incentives. This year they offered me in guaranteed money, HALF of what they just gave Kiwi guaranteed. HALF," Umenyiora wrote. "I'm not making that up.

4) Quer<U+00E9>taro (2.02): Also among Mexico's smaller states, Quer<U+00E9>taro is one of the most geographically varied, ranging from desert to tropical rainforest. The capital, Santiago de Quer<U+00E9>taro, was designated the "third city of New Spain" in 1531 and is a trove for history buffs. It is best-known, however, for its role in ending Spanish rule. Overshadowing such momentous events as Maximilian's execution or the signing of the Treaty of Hidalgo and Mexican Constitution, its greatest source of pride is being the place where the fathers of independence plotted to overthrow the Spanish. Ecotourism is the mainstay of the Sierra Gorda biological reserve. The state also claims three of Mexico's major wineries and maintains a Cheese and Wine Museum. San Sebasti<U+00E1>n Bernal, whose Pe<U+00F1>a de Bernal is the third-largest rock in the world, is one of Mexico's Magic Pueblos.

Lauren Lynn, nee Grill, was Ole Miss' first softball player to earn a first-team All-American mention and the school's first softball player to be an All-American twice. She set school records for slugging and on-base percentage while playing shortstop. Lance was a successful pitcher and a touted prospect, but his breakout came after college. In his final start for Triple-A Memphis in 2010, Lynn set a club record with 16 strikeouts. They came in a 20-batter span, and he blistered them with a spike in speed, working at 95 mph.
I've seen more rocks, singly and in great towering walls, than I imagined and have come to understand the enormous power of the Earth and water. Each time I've walked through a canyon or driven along the great salt flats I've marveled at the size of this park and of the changes the land experienced, beginning millions of years ago and continuing into the present. The fact that evidence of these changes is there for discovery awes me even further.

In contrast, a 1/16th cent sales tax for parks would generate $12 million a year, costing $8.89 each year for an average household.

Anglophiles and their friends donned formal togs for the English-Speaking Union's annual holiday affair known as the Beefeater's Ball at the Chagrin Valley Hunt Club in Gates Mills on Dec. 3. An intimate group of 100 guests sashayed through the historic halls during cocktails and a silent auction before sitting down to dinner of filet mignon. The unmistakable sound of Donald Willis' bagpipe called the black-tie-clad crowd to order for a round of holiday toasting and hopes for a successful fundraising initiative.

Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner, might be easier to elect than to nominate. The reverse might be true of Perry. Is he a wine that will not travel?

Like all utilities in California, it's under an edict to ramp up solar and other renewable energy. Putting solar panels along mostly unused roadsides is much better than taking up productive farmland.

And there's the other side of the coin. For those of you who didn't want to lose Schiano, does the way this happened - the timing - make you feel differently about the coach than you did before?

Victim 2: In March 2002, graduate assistant Mike McQueary walked into a locker room one Friday night and heard rhythmic slapping sounds. He looked into the shower and saw a boy of about 10, with his hands up against the wall. A naked Sandusky was having intercourse with him. The assistant left.

Curley and Gary Schultz, Penn State's senior vice president of finance and business, talked to McQueary about 10 days later. About two weeks later, Curley told McQueary that Sandusky's keys to the locker room had been taken away. The grand jury said police and child welfare agencies were never notified, and the officials made no attempt to identify the boy.

Jeff Schultz, Atlanta Journal Constitution: "Once you get past the emotional side that says Bobby Petrino just got run over by the karma train, once you get past the misguided Arkansas fans who started a Facebook page in support of their morally bankrupt coach and carried signs such as, <U+2018>What's wrong with scoring in the offseason?' this much is clear: Arkansas had no choice. Bobby Petrino went 21-5 the last two seasons as a football coach in the SEC last season. He's out of a job. What does that tell you? This is a sport where college presidents and athletic director have been known to give only lip service to matters of academic reform and ethics - and whatever flawed mindset exists in other conferences, it's safe to multiply that by 10 in the SEC. What Petrino did, however, exposed a public university to too much litigation and potential financial damages."

The issues were approved solely because of overwhelming support from suburbanites.

He would soon become a believer. The storm that slammed into the coast a year ago today ultimately caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to Oregon and Washington, killed 18 people, led nine counties in Oregon and 10 in Washington to be declared federal disaster areas -- and created a new yardstick for the potential ferocity of Pacific Northwest storms.

Yes, the Patriots did trade down twice after the first round and wound up making seven picks, but those two first-round upward moves went against the grain. Perhaps it's a sign that coach Bill Belichick is focusing even more on the present than he has during previous offseasons.

But do we deserve respect? Secretary of Education Arne Duncan noted in a speech last fall that most education schools are doing a "mediocre job" of preparing teachers. And he was being kind. Of the 1,300 institutions awarding graduate degrees for teaching, Harvard's director of teacher education told a 2009 conference, only about 100 prepared students for the classroom. The rest, she added, "could be shut down tomorrow."

Through licenses and other fees, hunters and fishermen already pay to help protect ducks and other game birds. But the amount Oregon spends on nongame birds -- bluebirds, finches, rufous hummingbirds and other winged creatures that are more fun to watch than shoot -- totals less than 2 percent of the state's annual wildlife budget. In recent years, researchers have reported noticeable drops in several species, including Oregon's state bird, the western meadowlark.

Santorum's Communications Director, Hogan Gidley, had a different take on the results. He said: "We've had two early state contests with two winners - and the narrative that Governor Romney and the media have been touting of 'inevitability' has been destroyed. Conservatives can now see and believe they don't have to settle for Romney, the Establishment's moderate candidate - who authored the model for Obamacare that provided taxpayer funded abortions, who boasted that he was more socially liberal than Ted Kennedy, and who supported Wall Street bailouts. There is a consistent conservative alternative who has the proven record of reforming entitlements, defending the unborn, and standing up for American exceptionalism around the Globe - and has proven that he is the one man in this race able to defeat Mitt Romney. That candidate is Rick Santorum. This latest defeat of Governor Romney in Iowa is just the beginning, and Rick Santorum is committed to continuing the fight as the clear, consistent conservative voice in this race."

The lack of a primary challenge to Mr. Obama may also be because many loyal Democrats have an appreciation not seen elsewhere of the difficult hand dealt to him by unforeseen circumstances and the dedicated obstructionism of the other party. Not only the two inherited wars but also the economic near-depression and a seemingly endless string of unanticipated challenges have obliged Mr. Obama to shelve his own pre-inauguration objectives.

The business of dying, I learned in the last few years, can be terrible. God doesn't take you just because you feel ready. The woman who never left the house without jewelry and a full face of makeup lay unadorned and helpless in a small twin bed.

5. In Game 4, for the first time in this series, Pujols did not have an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. The Cardinals' first baseman didn't take a swing with a runner on base at all against Randy Wolf. Pujols is 3-for-4 with two intentional walks in six plate appearances with runners in scoring position this season, and one of the biggest deterrents for pitching around Pujols is not who is behind him - it's who is on base ahead of him. Consider Game 2: Jay scored three of the five runs that Pujols drove in that evening. Protection is one thing. Prevention is also important. Enter Rafael Furcal. A Brewers slayer in the regular season, Furcal has vanished in this series. He went hitless in five at-bats on Thursday, and he's batting .167 in the series. Furcal has walked only once to up his on-base percentage to .211. That's no way to ignite and offense and it's a good recipe to give Brewers the ability to avoid Pujols, or limit his impact. The bottom of the order went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position on Thursday night, but it's the top of the order that could determine if the Cardinals' offense rejoins the series tonight.

Wash out the palm trees, half visible beyond the tap dancing platform. Palm trees are here, but they are all phonies, planted by people bemused with the notion of a sub-tropical climate, and they are so out of harmony with their surroundings that they hardly arrest your notice. Wash out the movie palazzos, so impressive in the photographs. They are here too, at any rate in a place called Beverly Hills, not far from Hollywood; but they are like the palm trees, so implausible in their surroundings that they take on the lifelessness of movie sets. Above all, wash out the cool green that seems to be the main feature of all illustrations got out by railroads. Wash that out and keep it out.
Here Mary shifts to the tragic toll gun violence takes, and doesn't return to the issue of the president - you can't fit everything into a column - and where the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance quality of newspapering comes into play. She wasn't tossing the ball to me, but I'm going to grab it anyway, and move it down the field, to mix my sport metaphors, since, as the election looms ever closer, a lot of groups are going to be asking that question.

It's hard to rank a 7-1 team so low, after all they're undoubtedly going to finish with a higher record than Reservoir. But Reservoir beat Glenelg on the field two weeks ago.

"The back-to-back receptions in honor of Warhol and Duchamp invigorated the feisty Los Angeles art scene," the author writes.

After Jimmy Pedro Sr. <U+2014> Big Jim <U+2014> narrowly missed making the U.S. team for the 1976 Games, he became obsessed with learning everything he could about the sport.

There were also low moments. The first involved a report on enemy strength during the Vietnam War that led to a 1982 libel case against Wallace and CBS by the subject of that report, Gen.

The third element, to complete the analogy, is the apparent inability of our City Council to effectively, collectively, deal with the problem. Splintered along the ideological lines noted above, the Council has been further handicapped over the last year or so by the numerous absences of Jim Vreeland. Discussions and decisions have been avoided, or delayed, or relegated to committees. The Council, at times, has seemed overwhelmed. Mary Ann Nihart and Len Stone inspire some confidence, but the two of them don't constitute a majority. They need help. Vreeland's resignation and Pete DeJarnatt's impending retirement will solve part of the problem. The full solution will depend on who replaces them.

The National League still frowns on package tours, says Reid, which it perceives as cooperating with <U+2014> and thereby helping fund <U+2014> the military government.

Unfortunately, some people are not capable of that," Gomez said, who grew visibly impatient with Riffle, the Windischs and the flier.

You guys are not constrained by the facts, you are angry, you are bitter and it's not healthy. I don't support recreational use of marijuana, but for you three I'd make an exception; you guys have got to lighten up."

<U+2022>Beware the gales of creative destruction. Netflix became hugely successful and beat out incumbent Blockbuster because it rode the technological wave of the Internet and DVDs successfully. It did this by building a business model around web-based browsing of selections, prompt delivery, online recommendation systems and exploitation of "the tail of the distribution" by stocking DVDs that appeal to a small percentage of the viewing population. However, many of the capabilities and strategies suited for this business model were rendered obsolete by video streaming technology, and competitors such as Amazon that had similar or better capabilities. Netflix's missteps were due to an inability to foresee the consequences of the force of creative destruction, and thus to renew itself in the face of change.

I think your words, which I enjoyed reading, struck a nerve. I will consider your view as I write about what it is really like in our classrooms. Today, though, a little boy asked me, "Do you know what?!" and as teachers we know the thing this child might say next could be just about anything. I asked him, "What?" and he said, "You always smile and get excited when you learn something! I like that a lot." So, my classroom is still a pretty fabulous place to go to work, and I love my job. My guess is you do too.
Less than 24 hours after his wife gave birth to their first child, the pitcher who threw a perfect game last month served up a career-high six walks. He was charged with three runs over six innings <U+2014> all came on a fifth-inning homer by Carlos Santana.
Sleeper Agent is the opposite of a typical Coachella buzz band. On the group's 2011 commercial debut album, "Celabrasion," members play a raucous, poppy take on the Pixies' early '90s brand of guitar scuzz, tempered with gentle synthesizers and meticulous drumming. It's not stylish at a festival where the Weeknd's narcotic R&B, Azealia Banks' spitfire electro-rap and high-octane dance acts such as Avicii have had the hype.
Clark Shipley, who groomed Authentic in Athens and in Beijing in 2008, said, "He was a little bit of a brat. He was on the small side, but he was never in awe. The bigger the jump, the higher he went. Stuff that scared other horses didn't bother him.
DeJoria began racing in 2005 at the amateur level in a 1963 Corvette Roadster in the NHRA Super Gas category. That same season she moved up, driving a rear-engine Super Comp dragster.

Scott McClellan, the president's press secretary, complained that the Newsweek report on the Koran was based on a "single anonymous source." That leads to the greatest irony in the current controversy: The White House is often the greatest offender. Although McClellan recently promised Washington news bureau chiefs that the practice would be curtailed, reporters are routinely called in for "background" briefings by White House officials, who insist they cannot be identified by name or title.

Nearly a decade ago I was on a national trends panel in New York where experts were predicting Indian food would be the Next Big Thing. It was a logical leap and made perfect sense. After all, Asian Indians are a significant immigrant group in the United States, particularly in Silicon Valley, and our polyglot culture has developed a palate for the type of spicy, full-flavored foods characteristic of Indian cooking.

Peirce isn't as well known as Pilkey or Kinney, though all three authors are in their 40s.

Peirce's success, however, has taken more time to arrive. He's been penning Big Nate as a daily comic strip for more than 20 years.

5. Forward Josh McRoberts: As of now, Hill currently has replaced McRoberts as the backup power forward that provides hustle plays. McRoberts' fluctuating role provides one of many examples where Brown's constant lineup shuffling has stifled the reserves' development.

So he'll have to stay ready to push the pace, dive for loose balls and crash the glass should he get back in the rotation.

If you're away from home or the office, many hotels now have computers with printers available for boarding-pass printing.

Hey, David: I am in total agreement.
Your editorial criticizes this legislation by saying it "stomps on the authority of local government." From the perspective of any business that operates in more than one jurisdiction, that makes no sense. Illinois has a well-earned reputation of being a difficult place to do business.

A: Except risking his future. Either he is ready to return or not. For the Knicks, what should matter most is Lin's future and making sure they're not risking it with the knee.

Mike Bibby can't possibly be the answer, although Toney Douglas should be back for Game 2 from his flu. If Lin has anything, he would be an upgrade.

2010 Angoris Collio Bianco ($33, 13.5%): This historic estate, dating to 1648, has holdings in three key areas: Collio, Colli Orientali and Isonzo, and while its Ribolla Gialla ($22, 13%) is very good, this classic Friuli blend - 60 percent Friulano, 30 percent Sauvignon Blanc and 10 percent Malvasia Istriana - is profound, with a beautiful floral accent amid lemony acidity, thyme and fennel seed. Texture sells it, an opulence that shows the seriousness with which Friuli takes its whites. (Importer: Peripherique Wine Merchants)

With new offensive coordinator Tony Sparano in the building, Tebow should give the Jets flexibility to use the Wildcat formation, which would play to Tebow's strengths as a runner.

He lived in Norfolk until 1964, when at age 38, he moved to Chicago to become producer-arranger and sax player at Chess Records.

Truth, it seemed, was a cheap commodity.

His food is innovative without being experimental or avant-garde, but includes sophisticated touches that veer toward contemporary French cuisine, such as rooster stuffed with foie gras de canard or grilled Angus fillet with chard and B<U+00E9>arnaise sauce. Still, he is well-versed in classical Italian cuisine, with exquisite dishes such as tartare of Piemontese beef cured in spices, goat cheese and pistachio fondue, or pan-seared sea bass with mozzarella and aubergine cake.

Leavy says that Mantle lived a double life.

* One of the comical things I continue to hear - and it came up on the Fox Network broadcast Saturday, during the Pujols Slobberfest - is that the Cardinals reacted to losing Pujols by overpaying Molina. The Cardinals supposedly needed to save face with the fans and did so by lavishing riches on Molina. Right. This, of course, is insulting to Molina because it implies that he didn't deserve the new five-year, $75 million deal that kicks in next season. This implies that he got the money because the Cardinals had to do something to score points with the fans - as if Molina is Jason Bay and the Cardinals were the Mets. It's laughable. The Cardinals paid Molina the big money because - as Tony La Russa and John Mozeliak have said - he's their one irreplaceable player. He is a lot more than just a catcher, and the people who still don't get it need to talk to the pitchers, to Molina's teammates.

A: I liken the restaurant to what's happening with the city. It took us a year (to finalize purchase of the assets). We had the opportunity to watch the restaurant work and to spend a lot of time in Detroit. We basically fell in love with Detroit and just thought what a great city and what a great story. The story of Detroit and the story of Small Plates kind of are running in parallel paths. It's like a microcosm of Detroit in the sense that it was once great, fell on hard times and is now having kind of a rebirth.

I applaud the affordable housing development proposed by REACH Community Development. The location at 231st and Cherry Street is near the light rail station and nearby shopping is within walking distance. However, for anyone who has to walk to ride a bicycle on 231st Avenue in either direction, there are no sidewalks, minimal bike pathways and just one pedestrian crossing. This is a problem for current Orenco area residents. We will only be placing more people at risk if the city of Hillsboro and the developer do not address these missing pedestrian and bicycle-friendly amenities.
I'm in Israel for a weeklong archaeological dig - not your regular vacation, but one that brought fulfillment and surprisingly more rest than I've gotten sitting on the beach.
Smith's easygoing demeanor will be a big change from Petrino.
Betabrand ($90-$98) was among the first to introduce an update on traditional work khakis. The San Francisco-based brand launched a bike-to-work pant that is full of details you'd never find in traditional relaxed-fit work-day pants. And these pants targeted young, fit, hip, bike-to-work, save-the-environment-and-look-cool-doing-it guys.

Even those who voted for the project <U+2014> Parks, Cadwell and Jennifer Hill <U+2014> were rightfully nervous that sales-tax revenue might drop, leaving the county scrambling to pay for the new building. However, sales-tax money has been the one shining spot in the county's budget. More money than was predicted is actually being collected, so the financing seems secure.

Take a second ... think about what you ate yesterday ... now, write it all down. In most cases you would fail in this memory test and put palm to forehead when confronted with what you actually consumed. When I work with clients it is interesting to hear their reaction after even one week of accurate food logging. Personally, I found that my calories varied drastically from day to day and my well-balanced diet was nothing of the sort. I encourage anyone starting or currently in their fitness journey to utilize this simple tool and remember the following issues that many people are troubled by.

The two men crossed the street and one of them punched Harris in the face, Isso said. Harris ended up on the ground, with Fariss Shayota on top of him, Isso said. The dog had Harris' arm or shirt in his mouth, Isso said. The fight eventually subsided and Yaldo and Shayota left, but returned with Naseem Shayota, who came running out of a nearby house. Fariss Shayota and Yaldo were behind him, he said.
At TIRR, rehab in one of the three workout rooms could mean therapy in the swimming pool, on a weight set, or on a machine that tracks arm movements to show patients if they're engaging the right muscles. The sound of weights clanging and rubber balls bouncing drift from the gym into the corridors. The halls are all fluorescent lighting and linoleum. In the garden out front, hot-pink roses keep company with boxwood hedges and a bronze sculpture of Prometheus Unbound. It depicts a man in triumph, freed from the chains that held him back.
Although more than 82 percent of the towns saw some increase in their average property tax bills last year, the 2.4 percent increase was a significantly slower rate of growth, the newspaper found.

"I guess I never need to go to a psychiatrist," Loretta Lynn observes in the forward to "Honky Tonk Girl," "'cause I get everything out in my lyrics." Plenty of songwriters would say that they, too, get everything out in their lyrics, but that doesn't nix their need for a shrink. But then Lynn, whose newest book is subtitled "My Life in Lyrics," is less complicated and pretentious than most. "I guess when you boil it all down," she writes, with indisputable logic in one of the many annotations to the formidable fruits of 50 years of songwriting, "every song is about me. It's my eyes that are seein' what I write about. And my heart that's feelin' all those things."

They are smaller in stature and they are unlikely to be armed."

Tollefson slammed the brakes a bit.
"The kid is a great athlete," Ross said. "He's done well in football, basketball and track. We need to get him healthy. Right now, he is a little bit sore but once we get him back and ready to go in track shape instead of basketball shape, he will be fine."
Were those the only choices, he might be right. But seen from the perspective of just a few months after the book was finished, the picture already looks different. No longer stagnant, the economy has begun growing again, and Obama appears at least even money, probably better, to win reelection.
But one day, Lucy had to make a stop on the way to pick up a prescription before the drugstore closed. Hidden behind huge sunglasses, she still couldn't hide her embarrassment at having bad hair in public, and so had her QuirkOut moment: She leaned in and whispered to the pharmacist, "I'm on my way to get my hair done; I usually look really cute." He looked at her prescription for Prozac, smiled and wished her good luck.

PG&E's own rules, however, would not trigger inspections unless the pressure on the lines spiked to more than 10 percent above the five-year maximum levels. Federal officials have called that interpretation "incorrect" - saying the law does not, in fact, allow the additional 10 percent cushion in pressure in determining when weld inspections are triggered - but have not otherwise acted on the spiking issue.
"There<U+2019>s no real progress. It<U+2019>s been two years, and it<U+2019>s all about the people, and the people are still suffering," he said. "It<U+2019>s terrible.

Another convenience food that wasn't so easy to prepare is the frozen pumpkin pie. It needs 75 minutes in a 400-degree oven. Basically, you'll need to make the frozen pie a day ahead, just like homemade. However, the taste was terrific - just as good as the recipe from the pumpkin can.
They aren't necessarily jobs Irish people want. Avril O'Brien, a 50-year-old Dubliner whose holistic-therapy shop closed last year, just completed a training course on call-center sales. She isn't terribly excited about the prospect of cold calling all day.

There are many country-folk revivalists in New Jersey, but few as reliably entertaining as Hoboken<U+2019>s Demolition String Band. Singers Elena Skye and Boo Reiners and their accompanists are traditionalists, and their appreciation of old-time bluegrass is absolutely sincere <U+2014> there<U+2019>s nothing staid about their delivery, which has the swing of Ricky Skaggs and the comfort of Jerry Garcia<U+2019>s Old and in the Way. These city slickers sing and play like a congenial aunt and uncle in a West Virginia mining town. They<U+2019>re also terrific guitarists, and the album is framed by instrumentals: Different versions of Skye<U+2019>s weeping <U+201C>Jethro<U+2019>s Lullabye<U+201D> open and close the set, and Reiners<U+2019> <U+201C>Boojo Breakdown<U+201D> burns like a shot of bourbon. As usual, the pair has come up with inspired covers: Their take on the Ramones<U+2019> <U+201C>Questioningly<U+201D> refashions the ballad as a backwoods ramble, and <U+201C>Alibis<U+201D> honors the memory and roughneck approach of Blaze Foley. As you might expect from an album so resolutely Appalachian, the financial crisis casts a shadow over the songs; outstanding originals <U+201C>Misfortune<U+201D> and <U+201C>Under the Weather<U+201D> sound more desperate than the Woody Guthrie cover (<U+201C>Hard Ain<U+2019>t it Hard<U+201D>).

Another night I tried the Short Rib Pot Roast with Potato Puree ($15). The hunk of meat was tender, lean and falling apart at the touch of the fork, but the reduction was too thick, a bit syrupy and intense, with a coffee taste.
Bahr skillfully portrays the tough, unsentimental facade that is Anita's response to a life of hardships, but she also lets us see the vulnerable, caring heart that lies beneath this brittle surface. She often loses patience with Davey, occasionally rolling her eyes or snapping at him in frustration especially early on, and even as she cares for the black eye with which he first appears, she distances herself from him with a kind of dry humor. Nonetheless, Bahr's Anita is not lacking in sympathy for this haunted visitor.
Tvert said he agrees. But he said he also sees no reason why people who don't support marijuana businesses won't support legalization.

In the last few years, major technology companies have become integral to interpersonal communication and information management. At the same time, many of these firms have tweaked user agreements in exactly the way Google has, helping the industry legally position itself for a mass intellectual property grab. That means whether you are using a photo-sharing site or a web-based e-mail account, you may have signed off on letting one of these corporations do whatever it wants with your data. As evidence of that reality, Facebook in 2009 let advertisers employ users' uploaded photos to market products without users' explicit approval.

Strengths: Quick's size is his greatest asset. His time playing football has been limited, and professional coaching could help mold Quick into a game changer at the next level. He is a reliable hands catcher who has the radius and grip strength to bring down any ball thrown near his area. He is a great option in the short game, as he understands how to use his frame to shield out smaller defenders.

However, there's other great stuff coming out of his small kitchen in this cozy Pacific Heights storefront; appetizers and main courses are equally good. Shelley Lindgren, who also owns A16, makes sure the wine selections and service keep pace with the food.

It's tough enough to raise girls in a culture that too often views them as objects. Every time we let a comment like that slip by, we demean what it means to be a woman. Sure, it was a joke. And, no, my nine-year-old was not up at that time watching Letterman. But making a remark like that trivialized and sexualized a little girl who has no responsibility for what her older sister did and should have a right to not be lampooned as an object of amusement.

Star power is not nothing, though, and "The Holiday" has that covered, thanks to its toothsome cast -- they're a dental paradise, this lot -- and to a premise (L.A. dame exchanges houses with a Brit) requiring little elaboration.

There were disappointments with regard to our agenda, to be sure. Instead of compact and competitive new legislative and congressional districts, we got power politics as usual.

Next, place flat side don and cut thin vertical slices, from one end of the root, or fuzzy side, without cutting into the root. Next cut horizontal slices up to the root.

In focusing on Jesus' humanity, both shows took his story no further than the Crucifixion: "Godspell" just hinted at the Resurrection; "Superstar" ignored it.

Set in 1950, "Young Man" harks back to the golden age of American realism and even has reflections of "Death of a Salesman." Will is no Willy Loman, but he bears a resemblance: a successful guy, a sales guy, a company guy, who's seen things slip. Business is down, something's gone wrong, things are unmoored. And what should he do? Ignoring it all and pretending everything's fine in their new dream house doesn't seem to be cutting it anymore.

EA: You're welcome. Now I do have to tell you, being hit in the face by the foul ball was bad. But my very first hockey game as a sideline reporter covering the Tampa Bay Lightning, we were in San Jose, for the morning skate. I was being a chatterbox, talking to our play-by-play man. He just said, 'Look out,' and swatted a puck coming directly for my head. It could have killed me.
There seemed to be some clever stagecraft at play on Friday, too, as the president and first lady spoke at a military base in Georgia with dozens of uniformed personnel behind them.

But on the tape, Williams urges the Saints to go head hunting after the 49ers' Kyle Williams, specifically citing the wideout's previous concussions. That is beyond inexcusable. That is unconscionable.
Matheny will make his debut on the road, like four other permanent managers before him. He will not debut against Pittsburgh, like four other permanent managers did since opening day 1946. Starting with the day that Hall of Fame manager Billy Southworth left the organization after the 1945 season and Eddie Dyer inherited a team that would win the World Series, 12 non-interim managers have done what Matheny will do tonight, taken over the Cardinals. Here is how each new manager has done in his debut:

It doesn<U+2019>t really seem like an accident that citrus fruits hold so much allure in the winter - and not just because of their vitamin content. How about the vibrant colors and that incredible aroma released when you peel or cut into the skin of an orange? Doesn<U+2019>t it just make you think of sunshine and positive thoughts? In fact, the essential oil of sweet orange and other citrus is proven to improve mood and decrease anxiety, and is finding widespread use in palliative care programs in mainstream medical institutions, including the Penny George Institute at Abbott Northwestern Hospital here in Minneapolis.

Although it's hard to say what an "average" family in California makes, $60,000 in taxable income is a reasonable estimate. In 2009, the median adjusted gross income reported by couples filing a joint tax return in California was $65,025, according to Franchise Tax Board data. (The gross amount is income before many deductions, so it is higher than taxable income.)
The transit lines -- if they make a final project list -- would be funded by a proposed regional transportation tax, which has the support of the chambers and community improvement districts, the self-taxing business groups that have invested heavily in transit studies along the corridors, as well as funding for voter education efforts with the transportation tax.

3.) In an odd sort of way, it sets the structure for (ready?) "The Sopranos," by making Rob Petrie's work family as important as his actual family -- blending and paralleling the two. This is precisely what Chase did with Tony's two families (although, granted, Rob was killing people with laughter).
The museum has a wealth of materials from the artist's estate. At the time of her death in 1986, O'Keeffe's two homes in northern New Mexico and most everything in them were set aside for preservation.
As the presidential election is just over six months away and both parties have chosen their candidates, the campaign is now fully with us. We are in a very serious and close presidential race; Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have very different viewpoints, but one thing they probably agree on is that the coming election offers a stark choice of two very different approaches to America's government, its economy and its future.

A: The short answer: No. It's invisible to the store clerk whether you're using a debit card as "credit" or using your credit card. Both require only a signature (and sometimes not even that). I would argue that any debit card that can be used as credit - meaning no personal identification number is required - is more dangerous than a debit card that can be used only with a PIN.
In Masters there is no qualifying standard to compete. You just sign up and race. Some champions come out of nowhere. Upshaw is not one of them. She's been competing for 40 years, and in the long jump she carries the best pedigree in the Bay Area.
The jury was empaneled after lawyers spent a day and a half of questioning a pool of about 120 people. Potential jurors' exposure to media coverage of the case was a challenge. About 80 percent of the 40 jurors questioned Thursday morning said they had read or seen reports on the Johnsons.

I think the Bears' perception of their offensive line is not the same as the public's perception of their offensive line. Offensive coordinator Mike Tice and coach Lovie Smith believe they can win with the linemen they have. The plan is to help the linemen more by not putting them is such difficult positions.

It was not his win-loss record that caused hopeful dads to put placemats with Wooden's "Pyramid of Success" before their sons and daughters every morning.

Who do you admire most in the world and why?
A. Certainly this shows that all teachers do not think alike. I did take my approach to the question last week and you have your own. The teacher writing in was specific in asking for help with her second-language population and she also recounted her experience knowing the grade level and what was expected. I was helping her with the students she was struggling to reach.

In fact, the Most Improved Player award has not necessarily been a precursor to greatness, and other recent winners have become worse after winning it. When Indiana's Danny Granger won the award in 2008-09, he also made the All-Star Game, but has not been back since and has seen his numbers fall each season.
Candidates are embracing E-Verify, a federal database that allows employers to check an employee's Social Security number against government records.

There are features of the GOP Medicare plan ripe for debate. As Democrats see it, it'll mean seniors get stuck with thousands of dollars of medical and insurance costs because insurers will pass those high fees on. The costs will come to $6,698 more for 159,400 seniors in Ohio, say the Democrats.

If the governor's intention is to validate the irregular family situations these children find themselves in, then what about the children of polygamous groups? Should their situations be legally recognized by the state as well? Will the governor also support the "triple-parenting" movement growing in jurisdictions that have redefined marriage to accommodate same-sex unions?
Barra said he did not know whether the fact that the question was revealed in public would keep it off future tests <U+2014> or what scorers would do if a crime was revealed.

5. Spritz on a toning spray (this step is optional but obviously super quick) to set your makeup, and you are out the door. I like the cool mist of the spray because I like anything that adds hydration, and it does seem to 'set" my makeup. Even without the eye routine, a little spray is nice even if you just fill a spray bottle with filtered water. Our Webster Groves supermodel Karlie Kloss recommended Caudalie Beauty Elixir ($16 for a 1-ounce bottle at Sephora) in the February edition of Teen Vogue, but don't let the "teen" shout-out fool you. The mist is actually formulated for "mature" skin and is designed to smooth skin, tighten pores and stimulate microcirculation (whatever that means, it sounds good, right?). I'm a fan of M.A.C's Fix+ spray of water and vitamins ($10 at M.A.C Cosmetic counters).
Researchers at Sloan-Kettering previously showed that removing polyps during colonoscopy can prevent colon cancer from developing, but it was not clear whether it saved lives.

There's the famous line from "The Devil Wears Prada," when a character is thrilled because she's "just one stomach flu away" from her goal weight. We have to admit, it is a silver lining of the Pepto bottle.

For the past decade or so, spirits have been eating into the market for beer, especially so-called "premium" lagers such as Budweiser and Bud Light. Liquor sales now make up more than one-third of the U.S. alcohol market, up from 28 percent in 2000, according to research firm Discus. Beer's share has fallen below 50 percent. Add in the fast growth of craft beers, and it's no surprise that sales of A-B's big brands have been slipping.

Aside from his late-night appearances, Watts maintains a thriving, artier presence on the downtown theater scene, where he usually collaborates with writer/director Smith.

Bob Bennett, a former Ohio Republican Party chief who was involved in back-channel negotiations over redistricting, said most top Republicans have long been skeptical that the Democrats can pull off a Christmas miracle. "There are some people that think the petitions are going to magically appear, but...it's impossible to do it with volunteers," he said. "You have to hire circulators."
Phillip got things going with "Volcano" by Damien Rice. "Because of the lyrics and the music," he explained. Fair enough. It's a really good song, although I can't imagine more than one percent of "Idol" viewers would have recognized it. Phillip accompanied himself on acoustic guitar with a cellist and a single backing vocalist fleshing out what may have been his best performance of the season. Truly haunting, soulful stuff. Tyler told him "I heard the musician that time." And for once, his words made sense.

Ideally, the revenue would go into the cash-strapped general fund. And even if it didn't, but was targeted for higher education, it's unclear that tuition breaks constitute the best use.

Chez Panisse has trained a lot of disciples in its 40-plus years, but no one is as true to the cause as Russell Moore. He cooked at the restaurant for two decades before going out on his own four years ago with Allison Hopelain. Each of his three main courses, which change nightly, is cooked over open flames in the altar-like kitchen. It could be grilled pork leg paired with smoked shoulder; mushrooms with beets and farro roasted in the wood oven; or a half Dungeness crab grilled in the fireplace.

In choosing sites, Google is looking for wide community support and readiness, said Meinrath, who has been talking with the company about the project. Google doesn't want to spend time dealing with right of way issues or objections from neighborhoods that aren't crazy about having Google tear up streets to install its network. In 2007, Google abandoned a much simpler plan, to offer Wi-Fi in San Francisco, after getting bogged down in the municipal bureaucracy.
"On the edges of PlayhouseSquare, there are about 1,500 units, but most people don't think of PlayhouseSquare as having a lot of residential," said Art Falco, the nonprofit's chief executive officer. "This project, I think, is going to start changing that impression."

After five decades of welcoming any local student who meets the minimum Cal State University requirements, the school is limiting admissions.
GPS technology is pivotal to what is essentially a trackdown plot. In that sense "Headhunters" is a digital update of Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 classic "The Conversation," with Roger's head<U+2014>what's on it, rather than what's in it<U+2014>as an analog to the apartment that Gene Hackman's surveillance expert tears apart in a frantic attempt to find a bug. The intricacies of the book, as adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg, track lucidly enough, with Roger going through all sorts of hell for reasons he can't comprehend. Still, there comes a point when the movie must be taken at its word that everything is working out as it's supposed to.

This spring, Pelfrey<U+2019>s mission statement has been to throw more sinking fastballs, to basically scrap the four-seam fastball and concentrate on becoming a ground ball machine. So far, no good.

The quintessential Van Gundy moment so far this season might have come on Christmas Day.

"He was a dreamer, he dealt with the war by floating up and dreaming. The six-letter word the "ambassador" is looking for but can't find has a humanist meaning. If you look at the context, you see that the word he can't find is "guerre," (or "war"). It's even more powerful because he doesn't say it."
Outside, the store's front window serves nearly as much news and advertising as the weekly paper. Last week, the "Wheeler County Buffalo Hunt" flier hung close to one offering "Pasture for Rent," and another for a "grandmotherly sort" interested in baby-sitting work.

For years I've resisted preaching about Jonah. I'm not sure why exactly, but perhaps I wasn't ready to tackle this story.

"One of the highly developed talents of President Barack Obama is the ability to say things that are demonstrably false, and make them sound not only plausible but inspiring," economist Thomas Sowell writes. "On this and on many other issues, you would have to know what the facts are to know that he is lying. He is obviously counting on the fact that, in this era of dumbed-down education, many people have no clue as to what the facts are. He is also counting on something else <U+2013> namely, that the pro-Obama media will not expose his lies. One of the many ways of lying smoothly is to simply redefine words. Barack Obama is a master at that as well."

While sitting on a long-haul flight on New Year's Eve, the gentleman seated beside me asked what I did for a living. As I explained my career and ambitions, he replied, "Don't you have kids?

Notre Dame faculty and alumni hope the tribute starts a new tradition of honoring the unsung contributions of women to the life of the church.
That being said, I also agree with E.J. Singler, who said yesterday that he thinks the Pac-12 is consistently undervalued on a national scale. In my opinion, that is more a matter of geography than anything; it is widely accepted that college basketball is better back east than on the west coast. Some days I think that perception is spot on, other days not so much. I guess we'll all just have to wait until the NCAA tournament to see if it's true this year. For the record, I predict three Pac-12 teams will head to March Madness. How about you?

The Blues outshot Vancouver 10-0 in the opening eight minutes Thursday night and played a physical game, finishing with 30 hits, including eight by David Backes.

The mid-century series focuses on the artist's time in the Ocean Park district of Santa Monica, and the canvases' soft color fields separated by hard lines are not only enveloping for adults, but are easily relatable for children, whose scribbles are abstract art in their own right, even if not by design.
As Louis Stokes rose to depart, I could only marvel at his grace, dignity and humility. Stokes, one of Cleveland's most beautiful and accomplished sons, never needs to apologizefor anything, especially running moments late for a meal.

On one level, I applaud TV makers who are willing to take chances and break with the familiar narrative approaches. That's certainly part of the appeal of "Luck," from veteran movie director Michael Mann and writer-producer David Milch, who already stretched the boundaries of TV with "Deadwood," his HBO reconceptualizing of the Western. They embrace ambiguity and unconventional TV narrative methods, which can leave you wondering what's motivating the characters as they jaw at each other in racetrack-speak.
Contaminated iodine and cesium rose into clouds that crossed the Pacific and dumped heavy rain along the California coast about one month later. Shortly thereafter, two scientists from Cal State Long Beach tested kelp from various parts of the Pacific Coast, finding no radioactivity off Alaska but plenty of iodine and cesium isotopes off California.

It's easy to read anyway, even in bright sunlight.

There is a strong sense that there is a desire to move our students that are flying at a high altitude to a higher altitude, so what strategies do we want to put in place, or what systems are in place to make sure we're doing that, while at the same time, eliminating any achievement gaps that might exist, whether it be a demographic or service achievement gap.

The Blazers (48-34) have been ousted in the first round in six games each of the last two seasons, suffering an upset in 2009 to the fifth-seeded Houston Rockets and squandering a Game 1 victory on the road last season against the Phoenix Suns. The franchise is searching for its first playoff series victory since 2000 -- when (gulp) the Blazers blew Game 7 against the Lakers in the conference finals.
<U+201C>When you look at the draft in particular and some of the areas in free agency that we<U+2019>ve addressed, I think it<U+2019>s put us in a position to just let the draft kind of come to us and not feel like we need to move around or not do anything that would put the organization in jeopardy in any one position.<U+201D> <U+2014>Schneider

Veterans with PTSD are two to three times more likely to be physically abusive of their wives and girlfriends than those without the diagnosis. They're three times more likely to get into fistfights when they go to college. One study showed they are especially prone to "impulsive aggression," but that "premeditated aggression" -- the kind of act Bales is accused of -- was far more common in veterans without PTSD than in those with it.
No hard feelings. But the successful professional sports franchises do not have absentee owners, nor ones who are detached, nor ones who think they know better than the GMs and coaches in the league. If the owner isn't truly committed, there is no point in sticking around, hoping and wishing for a franchise to figure it out.

On Wednesday, former race car driver Roger Penske backed out of his tentative deal to buy Saturn. When Penske Automotive Group Inc. agreed in June to buy the brand, the agreement called for GM to continue making the vehicles through 2011.

No, we've had an apartment in Jackson, Miss., that was hit by lightning and the whole building burned down. Then, we were in Hurricane Katrina in Biloxi, Miss. We were in a house just off the beach, the rest of the neighborhood was destroyed, but we were lucky. It takes a lot to freak us out, so the basement flooding wasn't too bad.
Until recently, you would have been hard-pressed to find a pizza, much less a short-rib pot roast with bone-marrow turnover pie and a cutting-edge cocktail made with chai-infused tequila. But that's changing as another generation of restaurants and cafes is sprouting between Olympic and Santa Monica boulevards <U+2014> amid the new boutiques, salons and food trucks. The neighborhood is a magnet for the hungry and the restless (which also means parking hasn't gotten any easier).

There is no rush to address the city's election calendar this year. Baltimore voters are not set to go to the polls again until 2015, which gives lawmakers plenty of time to adopt state Sen. Nathaniel McFadden's sensible proposal to hold one city election on the presidential cycle in 2016 (giving the current incumbents, including Ms. Rawlings-Blake, an extra year in office) and thereafter on the gubernatorial cycle, starting in 2018. Alternatively, the city could hold one more off-year election in 2015 and then switch to the gubernatorial cycle in 2018. That has the disadvantage of costing the city financially but the advantage of making sure no officials hold office for a longer or shorter term than voters bargained for.

As it was, the shrapnel appears to have damaged electrical cables and hydraulic lines inside the wing, Goglia said. Pilots were unable to close the landing gear doors, an indication of hydraulic damage, and had difficulty shutting down the engine next to the engine that disintegrated, an indication of an electrical problem, he said. The A380 has four engines.
Marcus Lagozzino, the oldest of three sons, had a history of mental illness and was living with his parents. He's had 10 contacts with Portland police as an adult, but all were low-level noncriminal, Simpson said. He was cited and convicted of an alcohol in the park violation in 1997 and had a criminal trespass charge in Sandy from August 2010. Police hadn't been called to the house since 2004, and that was a vandalism call.

"It boils down to one thing. You never know what happens when you get to free agency. I think it's a perfect fit for the Angels. I said all along the Angels would be in there.

What's a quick bread? By definition it's bread that does not rely upon yeast to rise, but rather uses baking powder or baking soda as the leavening agent. You don't have to let the dough rise or to knead it; just a quick mix of ingredients and pop it in the oven. What you gain in time saved, you give up in light, airy texture. Most quick breads are dense and very moist. Not a bad thing, if you ask me.

Michael Weiner, the stubbornly logical executive director of the Players Association, said last week that the steroid guys should be in the Hall, despite taking advantage of the rules. I don<U+2019>t disagree but I can<U+2019>t vote for them as long as the ballot I<U+2019>m given by the Hall says that I am to consider the character, sportsmanship and integrity of players. Steroids were an assault on the integrity of the game, and players knew they were playing fast and loose when they used them. As a voter, I can<U+2019>t get around those conclusions. Rodriguez will be a difficult case for me to decide because he was never identified as having tested positive, but the changes in his body <U+2013> both up and down <U+2013> make a lot of people wonder if something was up. Hopefully the Hall<U+2019>s board of directors will have provided some directions to voters on how to handle the outdated voting rules. But there has no been no indication of that, as the majority of my peers don<U+2019>t feel they need clarification.
The wagon was my solution. Its long, flat, edged bed holds quantities of birdseed. An old piece of screening laid over the bed prevents smaller seeds from disappearing through the corroded metal, and the wagon's flat surface enables many birds to feed simultaneously.

Tolls will increase by $1.50, to $9.50, on Sept. 18, for E-ZPass users, followed by additional annual increases of 75 cents through 2015, when the E-ZPass toll will be $12.50. Cash-paying customers will be charged an additional $2. However, the fee will actually be $2.50 at the start because the cash toll will be rounded up to the next whole dollar. That will put the cash toll at $12 starting Sept. 18 and $15 by 2015.

The Hallmark recall must be viewed within the context of meat industry consolidation, which has seen four corporations control 83% of the nation's beef production, according to the USDA. As the business has consolidated over 20 years, its clout in Washington has grown: witness the meat lobby's continued successful opposition to universal testing for mad cow disease, its ability to coax regulators to speed up processing lines, and its effectiveness in reducing both the role and number of inspectors.

Assemblyman Das Williams, D-Santa Barbara, is responding to an April 25 column by Dan Walters, "Close look reveals bill back story." That column criticized legislation by Williams, Assembly Bill 2218, which would require table saws sold in California beginning in 2015 to use technology to instantaneously stop whirling blades if touched. As Walters stated, "The bill was introduced after an Oregon company that makes saws equipped with such technology, SawStop, hired former Assemblyman Johan Klehs as its lobbyist."

In its first run, "Titanic" also played especially well in Asia, where the film's theme of self-sacrifice helped it premiere to wild enthusiasm at the Tokyo Film Festival and secure a surprising endorsement from then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Jiang called the film "moving" and told a group of legislators, "Let us not assume we can't learn from capitalism."

Renck's take:Other than Barry Bonds, I have never witnessed a better hitter than Pujols. Pujols has an amazing ability to get his front foot down on time, allowing him to clear his hips and generate ridiculous power because the bat stays flat in the strike zone so long. I haven't seen that swing this season. Pujols has adopted a desperate approach, crouching in his stance while becoming pull-happy. These are the hallmarks of a slumping player. I am not surprised that Pujols has struggled, just that it has gone on this long. It's impossible to overstate how easy life was for him in St. Louis. He was to the Cardinals what LeBron was to the Cavaliers. He answered to no one, other than manager Tony La Russa. His flaws were overlooked, his grumpiness ignored. He could do what he wanted, his greatness providing the eternal hall pass. Now, everything is different. To his credit, he has remained surprisingly upbeat, understanding how important first impressions are. Pujols will get hot as soon as he starts driving the ball to the opposite field. But his lost April means his first season will be modest <U+2014> 30 home runs, 90 RBIs, .310 average <U+2014> not memorable.

I don't want to make it seem like I am promoting her practice; she would not want me to do so, anyway. She does not need clients, and she didn't even know I was going to write about her.

"I'm really enjoying it, believe it or not," he said. "I probably don't show it. I'm enjoying the interaction with the coaches, I'm enjoying working with the players, I enjoy the process. I'm a very impatient guy. I don't enjoy the results yet. I think the people around me need to just tell me to keep going and relax, but I don't tend to listen to that very well."
But just to make sure that Escondido does not lose its reputation as the head waiter at the Wild Turkey Grill, Councilwoman Marie Waldron, who is running for the Assembly, floated a voter-ID requirement for the proposed charter, thus opening a first-of-its-kind can of squirmy worms that the city would have to swallow while she's occupying a backbench in Sacramento.
"This represents a gamble," said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "The gamble is that a majority of the public will prefer a deep deficit reduction and tax cuts, which the public likes, to the preservation of key domestic and defense programs and tax cuts for the rich, which a majority of the public also likes."

Commanders at the front, such as French and Douglas Haig, and politicians and propagandists at home, such as Rudyard Kipling, saw the war through the joint lens of sport and empire. British commanders in the First World War <U+2014> French and Haig are Hochschild's primary cases <U+2014> were shaped by the battles to enlarge and defend the British Empire, especially the Boer War. The fantasy of an "abiding, benevolent British Empire" lay at the center of their lives. They held fast to the idea of the cavalry as the primary weapon of war, completely in denial that "war was now an industrial process." Despite lessons from the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War, British commanders and strategists failed to understand how the machine gun, poison gas and barbed wire had changed the face of war and had made individual skill nearly irrelevant.
Records show that Jordan once asked Jackson County Judge Lewis Clymer to help Dearborn avoid a stiff sentence in a pending burglary case. Jordan quit intervening on Dearborn's behalf when he found out that he was involved with drugs, and police informants said Dearborn did not take the news well.

So far, Kagan, a former Harvard Law dean, has avoided taking a stand on most of the controversial legal issues that come before the high court. She does not have a record as a judge or legal advocate, and she did not write widely on legal topics, potentially making it difficult for Republicans to oppose her if she is nominated.

Utilities successfully argued for a measure allowing them to comply with the mandate by financing renewable energy projects outside the region. They could purchase renewable energy certificates, or RECs - pieces of paper that each represent 100 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy. Purchasing RECs from, say, a Texas wind farm, would probably mean lower cost for Missouri consumers than if a utility built its own wind farm here. But it would mean one less energy project would get built in Missouri, which therefore wouldn't benefit from any associated jobs.

That balance proved both impressive and reassuring to James Burns, the real-life inspiration for "Jamesy Boy." His family had known the Whites, and Trevor and Tim both say they were vaguely aware of Burns' problems with the law, spending time in a Colorado jail on an armed robbery conviction. But they didn't know the full story, about the hard-bitten inmate who helped turn his life around, until Burns came out to visit Trevor in Los Angeles.
But while James was upset to say goodbye to Ilgauskas, he gave a vote of confidence to General Manager Danny Ferry for his efforts to make moves and surround him with talent.

Using a stool sample that is taken at home, this noninvasive test identifies DNA markers for colon cancer. Though not covered by some insurances, the $250 cost of this test is much less than that of a colonoscopy, which can cost more than $3,000 when not covered by insurance or when insurance is unavailable. Colosure is now available for order by doctors and more testing is under way to improve the sensitivity of the test. This stool DNA test should be considered in cases where colonoscopies are not feasible, for reasons such as financial and medical concerns.

The premise is that an ambitious mayor (Andrew Daley) wants to close down Jellystone Park because of its budget deficit and then sell off the logging rights. When straight-arrow Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) is given a week to raise the money and save the park, he plans a 100th anniversary picnic and fireworks show, with the help of a visiting documentary filmmaker named Rachel (Anna Faris, once again adding ditzy charm to a dull movie). But then inventive oaf Yogi and his bow-tied sidekick Boo Boo (nasal voice by Justin Timberlake) get into the act. Cue the booty-shaking rap song.

"Ken was able to assess the talent on our team and design his game plan to match that talent," Armstrong said. "He's brought stability and an understanding of what it takes to win. But I have to say that there are great coaches out there, but without players willing to buy in and follow the game plan, it really doesn't matter. He's installed a belief system here, and the players believe in it. It was a team looking for someone to guide them, someone with experience, and I think he was the perfect part for what this team needed."
The current funding is a disaster, said board chief executive William Denihan. Compounding the county cuts is a 30 percent reduction in state funding.

The United States is among the few modern economies in the world that still circulate such a low-denomination paper currency. Today's dollar buys about as much as a quarter did in the 1970s. In Canada, the lowest paper currency is the $5 bill, and in Japan it's the 5 yen ($12). And yet, year after year, the U.S. government churns out billions of $1 bills to replace the billions of worn-out dollars that are shredded and dumped in landfills -- at your expense. Dollar coins, meanwhile, are virtually indestructible, fully recyclable, and have a lifespan of 30 or more years. It's simply a better, more efficient product.

Description: Before 2004, most parents would have looked at you blankly if you asked them about Holly Park. Though it's one of the city's oldest green spaces, it had a reputation for being a bit rough and the playground was, well, lame. A dedicated community effort brought about a $2 million makeover, complete with colorful playhouses, slides, swings, cargo ropes and a lovely little picnic area off to one side. At the top of the hill, there are basketball and tennis courts, and spectacular views.

A great star at Miami of Ohio 10 years ago, he has been the ideal teammate this season, hitting 3s, rebounding, pointing to assist-makers, and high-fiving everyone. That is the big picture. It is why the Cavs kept him. In the small, intimate close-ups that make up the playoffs, God might not be in the details, but victory often is. On that scale, he will be judged by inches.
Some may see the glass as half empty, but that's not how the legislative process works. Those who aren't willing to compromise seldom get anything done (Congress is offering prime examples of that on a regular basis).

However, in last year's World Series, the Rangers suffered a sixth-game loss that was nothing less Indians-like in depth and breadth, and then lost the series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals of Tony La Russa. He was the first manager to pamper closers by reserving the ninth inning for their use alone.
If he wants to call it a day, though? We completely, and utterly understand. And while every mention of the guy's name will bring up images of dour press conferences, his placement above Kevin Durant in the 2007 NBA draft, and all those 23-and-12s that we never got to watch, let's remember that those 82 games were significant. He was no joke. He was no fluke. This was a player with legitimate, game-changing talent that made an impact in his "full season" as an NBA pro. That should not be forgotten.
But the ultimate trajectory of human evolution, notwithstanding the central catalyst of competition and selection, tends toward a cooperative "super organism" capable of governing its actions to preserve its ecosystem (in this case, an entire planet) and thus its survival, Flannery argues.

Fortunately, ongoing talks among Dayton and legislators indicate that a "win-win" finish to the 2012 session is still possible. From our vantage, it doesn't look all that difficult.

So 10 years later we are spending $12 billion more annually, far exceeding any rational justification. Hardly doomsday.
The Browns were encouraged by their defensive performance last week in Oakland, in which they surrendered 10 points. After giving up 50 yards and a TD run to Darren McFadden on the opening drive, they allowed him only 41 yards the rest of the game. They're proud of their No. 7 ranking, and No. 4 against the pass.

I could list more than 100 different job titles and, like many of us, know nothing about them. But there is one job title I do know something about: firefighter. I was a professional firefighter in a local suburban fire department for nearly 16 years. During that time period, I traded shifts with other fellow firefighters in order to advance my education. Although there was no specific policy, rule or order in place, there was a very clear understanding: If someone did not get paid his time back with equal time worked (no cash was ever part of the trades), the fire chief would not allow any further trades to take place, in the whole department! That put each and every firefighter on notice; be fair to your fellow firefighters, and be fair to the administration of the fire department. As a result of this manner of administrating "time trades," we policed ourselves with honesty and integrity.

Biba excels in this category because the menu has something at various price points. The best deals are the pasta dishes under $20 and the $30 three-course fixed-price dinners. If you want to share, the restaurant doesn't charge to split a dish like many places do. The major entrees in the high $20s and low $30s are excellent options, too, though maybe for a special occasion. Wine prices also run the gamut and the mark-ups seem reasonable.

Anyway, Mariah says Kristy's version gave the diva "goosebumps." Kristy's not cut out for Mariah material, exactly, but she does a pretty good job. Randy says he didn't think that was "amazing." There were some dreaded pitchy moments, but she started stepping it up toward the end. Paula thinks Kristy, like Syesha, is smart and knows how to strategize what to do from week to week.

That's the political dilemma P<U+00E9>rez faces. We can think of more pressing needs than tuition relief for families earning between $80,000 and $150,000, and no doubt so can P<U+00E9>rez.

It's a reasonable way to bring in money and help Californians, and it ought to be approved, with some changes.

Defined as: Having or showing an excessive pride in oneself or achievements. I stress here the word "excessive." I find this quality in purveyors of virtue on both sides of the political spectrum but it usually lands on me as myopic, uninformed or not caring. I find the titles of Frank's Salon column somewhat smug as in: 'Did you leave the IRS a tip on Tax Day?' I guess that's a comment on liberal smugness <U+2014> generous tipping?

So now what? No one really seems sure. Burton relies on anachronistic humor -- Barnabas not understanding the world he's been released in -- to somewhat good effect, mostly because Depp is good at that sort of thing. But a little goes a long way, and you can't build a whole movie on it. It's probably silly to complain about lack of character development in a campy movie based on a soap opera, but other than Barnabas and Angelique, the other characters just sort of come and go, popping up every now and then as needed, nothing more.

Opponents included lawmakers from both parties. A handful of Democrats and Republicans rose in vain to try and stop the DUI blood standard. Sen.

Lang has been an energizing and polarizing figure in classical music since he substituted at the last minute for Andre Watts in 1999 at the Ravinia Festival, playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Chicago Symphony.

<U+201C>It<U+2019>s a very complicated medical issue,<U+201D> Irsay said. <U+201C>I think there are a lot of things that get lost in the shuffle in terms of really looking at the situation. And one of the things is just you haven<U+2019>t seen this in an NFL quarterback at all.

Navitat Canopy Tours, where I was, opened in July in Wrightwood, about 11/2 hours northeast of Los Angeles, joining a handful of other zip-line courses in Southern California. It offers a 31/2-hour airborne tour of the forest. The course, designed and installed by Bonsai Design Inc., looks like something out of a "Berenstain Bears" book. Curved tree branches form neat stepladders that give way to pristine rope and wood bridges. I half expected to see a bird alight on someone's shoulder and begin chirping out a Disney melody.

Ohio's General Assembly is like a Trappist (as in, "never talk") monastery compared to the Circus By the Mississippi also known as the Louisiana legislature. Perhaps the best chronicler of the Baton Rouge big top is veteran political reporter John Maginnis. Something he recently wrote suggests that antics in Ohio can get noticed in Dixie.
Well, once again, a different Liriano took the mound for the second inning. He overthrew his first pitch to Torii Hunter, stumbling with his follow through. Then, with a 1-0 count, he threw a meaty changeup, which Hunter deposited into the rock pile beyond the left-center wall. Two batters later, Howie Kendrick smashed another homer.
You can sit and spin through all the songs on the jukeboxes or select your own soundtrack as you wander among the exhibits.

That's the way I felt about the 10 courses that followed - a progression of vegetarian, seafood and meat dishes presented one at a time. They included gluten that looked like vinegar-soaked pieces of dark rye bread; shrimp, sweet and slightly crunchy with a mix of red, yellow and green bell peppers; bright soybeans tossed with paper-thin tofu noodles and goji berries; wide, chewy cellophane noodles with thin slices of fried pork; and orange beef that had a crisp, shattering exterior with only a subtle hint of sweetness.

I have seen and heard repeated complaints by both politicians and religious leaders that freedom of religion is denied them when others of competing faiths demand the right to practice what they believe. I rejoice in a First Amendment that allows me to believe what my church teaches, behave according to my church's rules, and share my faith with others by means of example, information and gentle persuasion. I do not assume the right to demand that laws from the state impose the disciplines of my faith on others who don't share it.

While the U.S. government is offering to shelve some deportation cases, some immigrants are rejecting the deal, preferring to take a shot at winning asylum or a green card in immigration court.

NW Natural has also proposed a new rate mechanism to recover costs associated with the environmental cleanup of its old gas manufacturing plant on the Willamette River. The company said the proposal could raise customer rates 1 to 3 percent.

Shareholders would bear 10 percent of the costs under the proposal, providing some incentive for the company to minimize costs and negotiate aggressively with insurers to recover the outlays.

Interestingly, the New York Daily News is reporting that Quaid had romanced another man's date at a party thrown by Serena Williams at her Los Angeles mansion last month. The Daily News report, which makes no mention of Quaid's newly-separated status, cites Twitter posts (since deleted) by Sascha Bajin, Williams' hitting partner, in which Bajin says he didn't quite realize Quaid had pulled a fast one until he dropped the actor off at his hotel after the party -- and saw his date follow Quaid out of the car.

Address safety efficiently. Safety is a critical concern voiced by bridge proponents, largely because of the "hump" in the existing span, bridge lifts and the overly close spacing of interchanges close to the river. The "hump" and the lifts will be solved by the construction of a new bridge. Both the Hayden Island and Vancouver City Center exits bracketing the bridge should be closed, with new arterial bridges connecting Hayden Island to the Oregon side of the river. Overengineering in response to safety concerns has gotten us into this mess. We can untangle it by addressing safety more creatively and by adhering to accepted design standards for the spacing of interchanges.

Incorporated as a city in 1850, San Jose got its first orchestra in 1879: the San Jose Symphony, ancient predecessor to the South Bay's current orchestra, Symphony Silicon Valley. This bit of history -- presented to Friday's audience in a pre-concert greeting from the current orchestra's president, Andrew Bales -- set me thinking: What sort of program would the 1879 orchestra have presented to the city's early culture mavens?

But Ms. Newhouse has learned that ideal acoustics are not even necessary for a hall to succeed. The essential factor is ambience<U+2014>the sum total of how a place looks, feels and sounds, an intangible combination that satisfies the senses and fills an important but unexpressed social need that extends from the audience's shared experience to its communication with the performing artists.

As most musicians will tell you: "You must learn to play the house."

That's the message Ralph Wilcox, provost of the University of South Florida System, gave last at a meeting of USF trustees. The shift comes after years of cuts to the university's state appropriation. The university's main Tampa campus is slated to receive $105 million less from the state in the next academic year than it did five years ago, and the system anticipates increasing tuition by 15 percent, the maximum allowable under the law, for the third straight year.
"It's appropriate to be cautious, it's appropriate to pay attention and it's appropriate to ask questions, but now let's watch and see what the researchers find out in the next couple of days," said James Culler, director of the UC Davis dairy food safety laboratory and an authority on BSE.

Lest you be hypnotized and dazzled by the smooth moves of these behemoths, it behooves a value-conscious fan of snow sports to go online and see what the medium- and smaller-size players are up to. For example, Sierra-at-Tahoe (which was left at the altar with corporate spouse Booth Creek when Vail hooked up with Northstar) has a $249 "Keepin' It Real" pass with zero blackout dates, good through next Sunday plus the 2012-13 season.

Someplace around Pago Pago, way out in the South Pacific, they assigned me a fale <U+2014> their name for a grass hut. I preferred the main building itself but was billeted in a fale (pronounced <U+201C>folly<U+201D>). It rained. Bigtime rain. Like with Sadie Thompson in that famous south-sea drama <U+201C>Rain.<U+201D> The hut leaked. Getting wet, I moved the bed. Next night another hole developed. I moved the bed again. Third night. Again. Fourth night it collapsed while I was in it.
U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) had requested the GAO audit and presented it Tuesday to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to bolster support for reinstating a tax that once financed the Superfund program.

(Just last week, it was announced Indiana households stand to receive $16.5 million in premium rebates under a provision of the new law limiting insurer overhead.)
On nights like this, we see the Hall of Fame journey mostly from the perspective of the man being enshrined. And that's how it ought to be. But it also can be reflected in the tears and cheers, the smiles and the emotions of the faces in the crowd. And so it was on this night that began so fittingly in a oversized high school stadium hard by Interstate 77, with Steve Sabol planting a tender kiss on his father's forehead. The air was still resonating with the distinctive sounds and memorable images that Ed Sabol helped create through NFL Films. Now, at 94 years old, he is finally getting his due as the finest poet laureate this game has ever known.

He<U+2019>s been going back ever since, starting out as a pot-washer, and eventually becoming the de facto boss. Davis insists that he is "only one piece of the puzzle," but his colleagues say that it is his selfless service and the respect and love that he shows the homeless (and even those who aren't homeless) who eat at the St. Francis table that holds the operation together. He has a particularly soft spot for the children who come to the St. Francis Table, and always manages to save a treat for the little ones.

Akron also rebuilt the soccer stadium.
The angst around the Brendan Ryan trade didn't crack the list, and neither did the annual vigil for Tony La Russa's return. Some things are inevitable. In a flash of instant armchair blogging, Jaime Garcia's spring training probably deserved a sixth or seventh consideration for the list. I was also reminded this morning that the closing of Club Flip shouldn't be overlooked. It was, after all, the CBGB of the lower west side upper corner of the Cardinals' clubhouse. The 20-inning game was historical and remarkable in the moment, but did it galvanize the team as some argued the morning after? Wasn't its role in the season faded by the time Brad Penny's

"Frontier's recent decision to place a significant and unjustified rate increase on its customers, along with the incongruity of Frontier's justification for that increase against the statements made in 2009 and 2010, makes us question whether Frontier has, or ever had, a good faith commitment to fulfill the terms of the franchise," Crest wrote.

Yet these filmmakers can't overcome the same problem creator Adam Herz faced in the previous three movies: The women <U+0097> with the exception of the quirky Hannigan <U+0097> are boring. Stars Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne are interchangeble, and the plot grinds to a halt whenever they appear. Perhaps it's not feasible to create well-rounded female characters in a series based on male lust.

"Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland" captures the Canadian rock trio Rush -- featuring singer-bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart -- during a sold-out concert at The Q in April. Directed by Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn of Banger Films, the electrifying souvenir came out last week on DVD and Blu-ray, along with a live double album with the same title. In this exclusive essay, Peart (the group's lyricist and best-selling travelogue author) reflects on the "Time Machine" project, memorable rides through Ohio via bicycle and motorcycle and Rush's long-standing affinity for Cleveland (where disc jockey Donna Halper was instrumental in the group's early success), despite being snubbed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

One of the worst matches was when the chef sauced the liver with a Pinot Noir and Bing cherry reduction and topped it with more cherries and pickled ramps and the sommelier poured the 2003 Inniskillin Vidal Icewine from Canada.

So I readjusted my snorkel, inhaled and pumped down toward the reef. Some members of our 19-member sailing expedition were already there, peering into an orange coral bigger than an armchair.

Romney won Ohio's primary narrowly, by 10,508 votes in the unofficial count, but he captured more delegates in the state and nationally than any competitor, giving him an edge well before the Republican convention in August. Others in the Republican presidential race say it is presumptuous to assume the former Massachusetts governor will be their party's nominee. Still, he was the Ohio victor, and in winning, he provided a glimpse of challenges he'd face in an election against Obama:

It is beginning to sound a lot like Christmas-which can be distressing if you wish to explore the spiritual possibilities of Advent. It isn't the commercialization of secular Christmas celebrations that bothers me so much. Let the retail giants have their say. But in our worship, in our own practices of faith, Christians should not exchange the distinctiveness of Advent and Christmas for prefabricated, overly commercialized reproductions.

Even getting defendants who are illegal immigrants to court may be problematic. State law forbids bond to illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes, which the Legislature defines as Class 4 felonies or lower, with lower numbers designating more serious crimes.

I visited St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina a few days later. This church is reportedly on the same site where Publius, Malta's Roman governor, welcomed St. Paul in A.D. 60. after he was shipwrecked on the island.

Early in their history, Bon Jovi was considered a metal band; a lite one, to be sure, but metal nonetheless. It was the mid-'80s, and if you wanted to play with the big boys in the stadiums -- and Bon Jovi always had those aspirations -- a metal edge was optimal. Bon Jovi shared much with the heavy metal bands of the period: a developed sense of theater, a passion for overstatement, and a taste for glorious bombast. But they've never had any time whatsoever for metal's nihilism. Even when he's sung about getting shot through the heart by the arrow of bad love, Jon Bon Jovi can't help but be positive.
The Local to Global event will display DeKalb<U+2019>s assets for local and international citizens and businesses.

I wish there were a handy nomenclature to describe the style of cooking Fenouil is turning out. "Modern," "refined" and "worked" are close but don't quite do it. "Formal," "composed" and "structured" are closer. "Transformational" even more so. I want to differentiate that from what I'd call "transubstantial" cooking, which is not just about changing the look or shape of ingredients but is elemental, changing solids to foam or fruits to edible paper. Transformational cooking simply cuts, prepares and arranges things on your plate in new and pictorial arrangements that keep intact the pun on palate and palette.

-- When I said the Giants had issues covering the middle of the field, I didn't mean they had nobody covering between the numbers. But that's exactly what happened late in the second quarter when Colston was all by himself up the middle of the field. And of course, that's the ball he drops, right? Colston was targeted six times all night; four of them came on that drive. The drop was the only incompletion. The rest were his only catches of the night: 50, 13 and 15 yards.

Our 27-foot fishing boat can hold 150 gallons of gas, and Gerry estimates that we filled it up three times between May and October last year. Filling a boat up at a marina often costs up to $1 a gallon higher than at the local gas station.

Europe eventually did establish a rescue fund in May. By then the price of calm had soared, requiring a pledge of <U+20AC>750 billion. It defused the panic but hasn't snuffed out the crisis: Unsustainable borrowing still poses huge challenges, especially in Greece and Ireland.
In any event, I still get all the catalogs that the various toy companies insist on sending my way. They haven't given up on me, apparently. I wouldn't if I were them, either. In my peak toy-buying years, I provided some of these companies with the equivalent of the national income of a small Third World country.

"It's kind of like a president announcing his Cabinet," said Barbara Radner, DePaul University's director of the Center for Urban Education, adding that she understands now why it took time for Emanuel to make the CPS announcements. "It's not 'where's the CEO?' It's 'what's the big picture?' He's filled in the executive suite, and no one's ever done that before."
Here<U+2019>s one example: It was just five months ago that some geniuses (hello) were suggesting that Osi Umenyiora might be a distraction this season, while other geniuses (hello again) suggested that the Giants would be wise to give the player<U+2019>s agent enough leash to broker a deal for draft picks.

The rise in lay conservative fervor comes at a time when the need for activism would seem less urgent. The U.S. hierarchy has seen a wave of retirements in recent years that has swept out leading liberals. The men taking their place are generally more traditional and willing to take a harder line against disobedient Catholics, from politicians to parishioners.

After his election, instead of living in posh, mayorly quarters, he continued to live in one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city to better stay connected with the people. During a 2010 blizzard that paralyzed the city, Booker grabbed a shovel and got to work. And when late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien began taking potshots at Newark, Booker turned the joke back on O'Brien, banning him from using Newark Liberty International Airport and demanding a public apology. The running "feud" ended when Booker made an appearance on the show to patch things up.
As for "Terra Nova," this is a Big Production, as you'd expect with Steven Spielberg's name in the credits (he's an executive producer). The pilot has echoes of big-screen ancestors, including "Blade Runner," "Avatar" and "Jurassic Park." The premise: Earth in the year 2149 is bleak, its resources exhausted, its surface choked with overpopulation. The only hope: send people back in time to the good old primeval days, where they can take a second run at this whole establishing a civilization thing.

"Of course I'm disappointed," said Heather Peters, who brought the suit, "but I'm still glad that I raised awareness that Honda is no longer the great brand that it used to be. They used to go the extra mile in customer service; now they go the extra mile fighting customers in court."
Iowa State and Iowa meet Saturday for the Cy-Hawk Trophy, an award whose latest incarnation was so poorly received that it was withdrawn from circulation, perhaps never to be seen again.
Kansas faced third-and-goal from the Iowa State 1 in the middle of the third quarter, trailing 10-7. The Jayhawks had blown several scoring chances in the first half, and this was the period of the game that had killed them all season. On the macro level, this was a statement play for their embattled coach. On the micro level, with 36 inches of grass separating them from their goal, it was about the players.
A Plain Dealer review of meeting minutes found six other cases where Hagan and Dimora teamed up on votes -- with Jones abstaining or dissenting -- since last July.

Karl Lagerfeld, by contrast, decided to embrace the downturn. Mr. Lagerfeld chose the more intimate setting of Cambon-Capucines Pavilion for his event instead of Paris's Grand Palais.

When he was still alive, Jackson was a big fan of Cirque du Soleil, and regularly took his family to see the company's shows. It would seem a natural fit for Cirque to create a show honoring his musical legacy. Instead, "The Immortal World Tour" shows how big of a creative vacuum was created by his untimely death <U+2013> one that's impossible for mimes, contortionists and acrobats to fill.

Reed had urged the council to trim pension benefits for all new city workers hired after July 1 except for police officers and firefighters, and to add a cheaper health plan for current and retired city workers, something aimed at shrinking the city's retiree health insurance bill by making retirees pay deductibles or higher premiums.
She argues that the leadership industry has been peddling the idea that great leaders can change the world. This worked in a time when followers actually believed in their leaders. When Americans did not know of rumors that President Kennedy was sleeping with several different women, they believed in the vision of Camelot.
"No offense to Andre <U+2013> he did great here ... but what I'm going to bring that he didn't necessarily do as much is I'm going to really push the ball up the court," Felton said Monday, after being introduced along with draft picks Nolan Smith and Jon Diebler.

The controversy over USC continues: Are the findings accurate? Should Carroll have done more, earlier? Is the punishment excessive? The answers won<U+2019>t matter, because I have no doubt that Bush-like situations will continue to emerge throughout college football. This sort of thing has been going on for years, and the incentives to keep it up are too strong in the current system.
Then nothing. The Titanic, and Phillips, had fallen silent.
The highest concentration of the bugs was in neighborhoods near Dodger Stadium. Officials also closely monitored the San Gabriel Valley, once the orange capital of California, before the industry moved to Central California. Only one bug so far has made it to the Central Valley, the heart of the state's commercial citrus industry, and it did not test positive for the disease.

The 10-year old finished dinner early, then went upstairs with her friend. Though her parents' bedroom was off limits, the girls went into the room so they could look out into their backyard to try and see where Easter eggs were hidden. They began to play with the gun on the nearby dresser; the gun went off, hitting O'Connell's daughter in the leg.
Most of the time, I'm fighting back the tears, unsuccessfully, but it's an incredible feeling of expression and such a meaningful connection. The show's been incredible and I hope that people in Detroit will enjoy it ... and take that earlier cue about the standing ovation.
Wall Street gnawed on a muddle of economic data and corporate earnings Thursday, pushing stocks lower after a brief rise.
Jamie quickly masters the trade, taking the advice of his boss (Oliver Platt), getting in good with a "thought leader" doctor (Hank Azaria) whose influence will cause others to prescribe his drugs. But then Jamie meets a patient, one with a wicked wit, a wicked temper and a funny attitude about her health. Maggie (Hathaway) is "not too bummed about having a major degenerative disorder at 26." And she's not interested in Jamie's mating games. Cards on the table, a tumble on the bed. Just don't call her "girlfriend" or it's over.
At a time Karr's public defenders were seeking to throw out any DNA samples already taken - and block new sampling - they won one legal battle.

What a cool concept: a family-owned Asian hypermarket. Kansas City has long been blessed with little specialty Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese markets. Emphasis on little. Many are tiny, and midsize ones often have the aisles crammed so close together they feel little. The new 888 International Market, 10118 W. 119th St., Overland Park, could not be more different. Walking through the automatic glass doors feels like stepping into Target <U+0097> in Shanghai. Owner Tim Liu opened the store, which has almost 6,000 square feet, in December. The inventory is truly pan-Asian, with Korean, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese products as well as Chinese. Seafood fans should check out the competitively priced lobsters and crabs in tanks. Bubble tea lovers will want to check out the caf<U+00E9><U+0092>s new slushy versions, and the selection of frozen dumplings and pot stickers (pick up dipping sauces a few aisles over) is worth a trip by itself. Don<U+0092>t miss the housewares area at the far back of the store, where you will not believe the size of steamers and woks <U+0097> up to 4 feet in diameter. Best value tip: on a recent visit, stems of Stargazer lilies with three or four salad plate-size blooms were $3 each. The checkout area induces an oddly happy feeling, with each lane decorated to the hilt with red banners, lanterns and lucky cats.

If Blackmon is there, take him. And Blackmon sitting there at No. 6 still is the most likely situation. And even if the Rams take Blackmon, then they should seriously consider pulling another wide receiver off the board in the second round. (A.J. Jenkins, anyone?)

The centerpiece of this exhibit is Chihuly's Laguna Murano Chandelier. More than 1,500 separate pieces of glass <U+2014> long, curling strands of gold and olive green <U+2014> are bundled into five clusters, some hanging from the ceiling, others rising from the floor. The chandelier (it arrives in individual pieces and must be assembled on-site by Chihuly-approved installers) looks right at home at Foothills, a converted 1872 church with some stained glass of its own.
Tracy offered $50. The men settled on $75, he said. And since that day, Tracy figured he'd get the ring back to Webster because "if it was my ring, I'd want it back."
I'll be preaching this Sunday, which happens to be Mother's Day, but I won't be preaching about motherhood. I'll stick to the lectionary, and preach on the story of the disciples who encountered Jesus on the Road to Emmaus. When I mentioned this on Facebook, a friend wrote back that I don't need to preach about motherhood, because my presence in the pulpit says it all. That struck me, hard. I grew up in a church that does not ordain women, and while I am very grateful to that church in many ways, I do wonder how my life would have been different if I had had even one female role model in church.
There will be no street closings in New York or New Jersey during the work periods to provide detour routes.
For example, the school doesn't do the scale of printing that would justify hiring a contractor to run the entire operation. And Oberlin has a good structure in place for running its residence halls.

Or, dare to try the 3-pound burger challenge ($30): It's nine patties and cheese, and the towering burger is free if you finish it in less than 10 minutes.

NEW YORK <U+2014> You<U+2019>ve got to believe the Yankees circle nights like Friday night on their calendars.

New York's last postseason win came April 29, 2001. The Knicks get another chance to end the drought Thursday when they host Game 3.

All of which leaves high speed rail just about where it should be at this time: free to proceed if legislators let it, unless lawsuits somehow stop it -- and so far there are none looking potent enough to do that.

That's a striking contrast to what happened in 2009 when the Pentagon conducted a photo-op flyover in lower Manhattan by a passenger jet and F-16 fighter. The sight of the aircraft flying past the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan's financial district set off a flood of 911 calls and sent office workers rushing into the streets in panic.
State audits in 2006 and 2008 found that the state Department of Public Safety did not adequately track how money was spent.

* Fancy Houses!: Nothing like an episode featuring wealthy characters to show off Portland-area swanky homes. Lucinda and her husband -- who has lost their fortune to a crooked investor who was apparently Portland's answer to Bernie Madoff -- live in a lovely spread. Mavis, Lucinda's stepmother who refuses to open the purse strings to help out the desperate husband, also boasts a house with spiral staircase and gorgeous chandeliers. Mavis' daughters, Tiffany and the ever-sobbing Taylor, both live large, too. I haven't seen this much upscale house porn since the most recent Nancy Meyers movie.

Health experts say a community needs about 95% of its citizens to be immunized against measles to ensure herd immunity, where vaccinating a large percentage of a population keeps even unvaccinated people from getting the disease. Even people who aren't vaccinated, such as newborns, get some protection from herd immunity as the disease remains limited to a small part of the community. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory condition that can lead to encephalitis, pneumonia and death. Other diseases, depending on how contagious they are, require other rates of immunization for a community to benefit. For mumps, 88% need to be immunized, and for chickenpox and polio the rate is 90%. "The Northwest is a black hole for religious exemptions" from vaccination, says Lorraine Duncan, immunization manager in the Oregon Health Authority's Public Health Division. Last year, 5.6% of Oregon kindergartners had a religious exemption for vaccines, up from 2% a decade ago, Ms. Duncan says. In some school zones around Eugene and Portland, more than 10% of children have religious exemptions, and in pockets of the state's southwestern corner, exemption rates are more than 20%, she says.

Ms. Golisz says her husband's health declined last year to the point where he was "making snap judgments" on the road. She was the one who told him to hang up the car keys. "It's for our safety," she says. "I don't want to die with broken legs and bones. I'd rather go out like a candle in the wind." The keys still hang over the sink, but since their talk, Mr. Golisz says he hasn't used them. "It's foolish to keep driving if you're not making good judgments," says Mr. Golisz, a retired safety officer at an animal research center.
The Clinton administration's Northwest Forest Plan in 1994 reserved 6 million acres but was supposed to guarantee specific amounts of logging on other lands. Those numbers never materialized.

1. "Justified" (FX): Even if AMC's "Mad Men" had aired original episodes in 2011 (which it didn't), "Justified" might still have claimed the top spot.

In the hands of "Shine" director Scott Hicks, it does what it needs to do to please its target audience with a certain tasteful artfulness and the comforting familiarity of a 1950s melodrama.

President Barack Obama's deficit reduction plan, unveiled this week, calls for eliminating these controversial direct payments, as well as shrinking the government's contribution to crop insurance and conservation programs. Despite tough economic times, farm income is predicted to hit record highs this year and has been soaring, particularly for grain farmers, over the past decade. A recent White House report called the payments indefensible and targeted them to help reduce the deficit. Overall, the president's cuts would result in a savings of about $33 billion over the next decade.

Later in the year, The PD would send its own "special correspondent" to Gettysburg for the dedication of the national cemetery. Alas, in the days afterward, the paper would be forced to run telegraphic accounts from other papers instead -- ignoring Lincoln's short speech, focusing on the oration of Edward Everett Horton -- until, about a week later, its correspondent's telegram straggled in, unaccountably delayed. Perhaps that reporter was wise enough to see the merit in what would become known as the Gettysburg Address ... but we'll never know, because the PD said that the delay in receiving the account had rendered much of it pointless to print, and it ran only a few paragraphs skipping all the speeches.

If the Broncos make a trade on the first day of the draft, I see them hoping for a quality player to fall in the first round who gives them the opportunity to move back into the top of the second round.

Checking accounts fleeced <U+2014> A Culver City man has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for his role in a sophisticated scheme that stripped more than $1.6 million from Wells Fargo & Co. checking accounts. Sean Bazille, 45, was convicted of charges that included conspiracy and bank fraud. He is one of 17 people convicted in the scam. The scheme<U+2019>s organizers paid Wells Fargo employees to provide account holder information, then used it to produce and cash bogus checks, the U.S. attorney<U+2019>s office in Los Angeles said in a news release. They also had bank employees change customers<U+2019> telephone numbers on file with the bank so that someone involved in the scam would answer the phone if the bank called to inquire about suspicious activity.

The bags of dog food have more heft than this plodding, paint-by-the-numbers romance, and Efron isn't given much to do beyond look good in boxer briefs. All the soaking-wet outdoor-shower-sex scenes in the world can't make up for the lack of chemistry.
This is Keudell's second career Pac-12 Pitcher of the Week selection and Oregon's fifth all-time selection.

These hues drifted into the early 1950s -- think Fiesta ware, Revlon red lipstick, a turquoise Studebaker. The era brings to mind youthful optimism, and color reflected that.

It was a big weekend for Paltrow and Martin. "The Avengers," which features a cameo by Paltrow as Pepper Potts, broke records at the box office, and Martin made news thanks to his heartfelt, soulful L.A. performance of (You Gotta) "Fight for Your Right" (to Party!) in tribute to Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, who died on Friday from cancer.

The crew takes organic chicken parts, brines them in buttermilk and lemon overnight, and fries them in sunflower oil. The result: the kind of crispy skin that when chewed makes noise like a fire's crackle, and meat so tender it would yield to a breath.

During his first day on the stand Tuesday, Pettitte recalled the crucial conversation, which took place at Clemens<U+2019> home during a workout, as: "Roger had mentioned to me that he had taken HGH." Pettitte<U+2019>s testimony <U+2014> as a reluctant witness with no ulterior motive <U+2014> is considered vital for the prosecution<U+2019>s case, which otherwise relies heavily on Brian McNamee, a former strength coach for both Pettitte and Clemens who says he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone.
Jon Gruden's ESPN QB camp with Brandon Weeden
Lucas admitted that it was tough keeping everything together as the match went along. The atmosphere was electric. The game was intense. The state championship was in the balance.

My advice to Vikings owner Zygi Wilf and his family is to put the team up for sale and move on if they suffer a defeat this week. If a stadium doesn't gain approval now, when will it? They've never been this close, but stadium fatigue will only intensify.

House Majority Whip Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta, worked on the regional transit idea last year and this year.

The very presence of appetizers and side dishes seemed like overkill; perhaps they're intended as bar food or as an alternative for those who don't want a burger. Smoked onion rings ($7) looked like 10 doughnuts piled on a plate, and the smoky edge was an interesting flavor twist and worked well with the kicky cheese dipping sauce served on the side. The breading on the two end pieces, however, had clumped together and was gummy.
The June numbers largely reflect sales that were initiated in April. Sales gains could decline a bit in future months, as the spring and early summer buying-and-selling season ends.

The application notes swift passage of Gov. Chris Christie<U+2019>s education reform bills would make it easier to implement the state<U+2019>s proposals. Legislation the governor supports includes overhauling teacher tenure, offering bonuses to the best teachers and expanding access to charter schools.
The Indians are really closer to the playoffs, particularly after the addition of an extra wild-card team, than their Cleveland rivals. But they generate less excitement than either. Despite the occasional splurges by the Dolan family -- Ubaldo Jimenez (Ouch!), Travis Hafner (Ow-wee! again), Asdrubal Cabrera and Carlos Santana (Let's wait and see, but have the iodine ready) -- the franchise is considered cheap in the court of public opinion.

On her bad days, the only things not hurting are her feet and hands.
Under the proposal, the BLM would transfer 1,268 acres surrounded by mostly private land in Pitkin County in Colorado to Two Shoes Ranch, which is owned by Leslie and Abigail Wexner.

The luxury tax Dallas paid after last season will be more like $50 million when the stiffer tax kicks in for the 2013-14 season, so it's hard to blame the Mavericks for basically not even attempting a good-faith effort to repeat. As Sefko wrote, "Management didn't exactly go all-in when it came to retaining (or replacing) a championship team."

Planning a surprise shower can be challenging, but well worth the look of shock on the bride's countenance or on the faces of the couple when they enter the room. Make this decision early, since it will affect how you proceed with fine points. If the bride is aware of the event, perhaps unexpected guests or some details can be kept secret.
<U+00F8>Like any full moon, the supermoon would appear bigger when it's on or near the horizon rather than higher in the sky, thanks to an optical illusion, Chester noted. The full moon appears on the horizon at sunset. On the East coast, for example, that will be a bit before 8 p.m. Saturday.

By the end of the year, Mr. Pistole said Precheck will be in place at 35 airports and six airlines, covering most major U.S. airports and airlines.

Katniss is so skilled with a bow and arrow that when she shoots a rabbit for food, the arrow usually pierces its eye. Here's how Katniss finishes off a dying competitor in "The Hunger Games": "Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound, and I know where his mouth is. And I think the word he's trying to say is please. Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull."

Duh! Who knows? All we know at Starting Blocks is that it's great theater. Now sometimes, as with Jets' head coach Rex Ryan's hirsute and bepillowed impression of his twin brother, Browns defensive coordinator Rob, it's theater of the absurd. And sometimes, as with delusional wideout Braylon Edwards' assertion that he was disliked in Cleveland because he went to Michigan, it's just absurd theater.
Bernstein, now a high school sophomore, said Monday he is doing better after enrolling in a different school and undergoing psychological therapy. But he worries about other students, telling lawmakers they need to adopt the "Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights" to protect them.

Since the 1980s, police departments across the country have paid more attention to so-called quality-of-life crimes. A crackdown on minor infractions, the idea goes, creates more community pride and puts behind bars more people who might otherwise be committing serious crimes.

The GOP Legislature has used its power politically to target and shut down unions, which represent the interests of the people. Collective bargaining is about guaranteeing that teachers, bus drivers, custodians, food services workers, nurses, firefighters and others have a shot to put food on the table and the middle-class dream.

Whether it's a lobbyist-written trade deal lurking beneath a bill extending unemployment benefits or a corporate subsidy undergirding a must-pass defense spending bill, this is the way some of the most corrupt policy has become law in recent years.

As little respect as I have for the people at Heartland and their secret financial backers, whose irresponsible work is helping to assure a grim future for our children, I suspect they're not brain-dead enough to equate Nobel prize winner Al Gore with Osama bin Laden. Under the theory that any publicity is good publicity, they have mounted an ad campaign so calculated to outrage that it will attract nationwide media coverage, thus magnifying a relatively meager ad budget into a national campaign. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is one group that has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, but I'm not sure it has done much to aid PETA's cause.

For years, Fuller has been a voice of reason and calm in an otherwise hysterical debate about the root causes of the contemporary logjam. He does not apologize for terrorism or violence in the name of God, but he has been consistently critical of the myopia of Americans about their own role in feeding the current hostility. And with a pedigree that includes years in high-level positions in the CIA, his critiques should carry unusual weight.
Studies such as this one do not establish whether sleep drugs are a cause of the increased cancers and deaths or whether, perhaps, those who are at greater risk of dying or developing cancer are simply more likely to seek a prescription for sleep problems. To establish such cause-and-effect relationships, clinical trials, which would compare subjects taking sleep medications against those taking a sham drug, would be necessary, said study coauthor Dr. Daniel F. Kripke, a professor of psychiatry emeritus at UC San Diego now affiliated with the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla.

In a sense, the bus trip organized by author Ken Kesey in 1964 was the opening salvo in the culture wars of the 1960s. Kesey was an early tester and proponent of LSD, and he envisioned a caravan of comrades who would push boundaries and blow minds on a trip from the West Coast to the World's Fair in New York. Behind the wheel was Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac's speed-freak sidekick immortalized in the novel "On the Road."

The documents come from a confidential proposal by Felix J. Dawson, a former Goldman Sachs and Constellation Energy executive, to effectively buy out Baltimore Racing Development. Whether his plan, which involves a $3.3 million infusion of cash from his investment company, Wilkes Lane Capital, would be enough to right the finances of the race is hard to say.

Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to charge $30,000 per dose, or $120,000 for a four-dose course of treatment, Bloomberg News reported.

Evidently, I did not make it clear that I was articulating the theological differences between Mormonism and traditional Christian theology; in the article I was portrayed as somebody who wouldn't vote for a Mormon because I don't think his theology is up to snuff.

With Luther, I would rather be governed by an honest and capable man of a different religious faith than by a corrupt and ineffective politician who attended my church.

"Tarnished Angel" moves systematically from desire to degeneracy, from degeneracy to clarity. In its trajectory and its insight, the poem recalls the best work of Horace, the Roman poet of the Augustan Age, who wrote "if you wish to weep, you must first mourn yourself." That's the kind of logical notion that epitomizes a sensibility of the poised and even-keeled, the very sort of mind and art Powell has mastered.

Whenever a sorcerer enters the scene, or a demon flits across the page, some kind of literary depreciation effect still sets in (though the tide is changing).

Who among us with the slightest acumen toward self-reflection doesn't fully understand that the more you wail against something, the more violently outspoken or hateful you are against this or that perceived indiscretion, sexual proclivity, perversion, deviance, expression, delight, taste sensation, the more certain it is that said deliciousness secretly attracts you, turns you on and makes you enormously, terrifically scared?

First-year UNLV coach Dave Rice, a former BYU assistant who played on UNLV's 1990 team that won the national championship in Denver, promised he would bring back the Runnin' Rebels, turning up the tempo from the more deliberate style of Lon Kruger, who left Las Vegas to be Oklahoma's coach.

"It's a great illustration of a program that did it the right way, and we were still able to win at the highest level," Stansbury said. "There is cynicism that says being a great student-athlete and being able to compete at the highest level are mutually exclusive. But I don't believe that at all.

The multiple-head growth is likely due to some form of damage to the meristem -- externally or internally. This may be due to damage or just a strange form to produce more flowers.

In the hours leading to the Arizona debate, Romney called for a 20 percent across-the-board cut in personal income taxes as part of a program he said would revitalize the economy and help create jobs.

High-frequency firms use computers and mathematical formulas to exploit split-penny price differences. High-frequency trading is estimated to account for more than 50 percent of all U.S. stock trading. The firms often employ a practice called "quote stuffing," in which huge numbers of artificial orders to buy or sell are placed and then canceled almost immediately. Regulators say the practice may create the illusion of greater trading volume, potentially allowing sellers to profit from the perception of rising demand.

What was needed was a new, bold, forward-thinking system run by experts with access to the most modern techniques. For Wells, the label for such a system mattered less than the imperative that we implement a revolution-from-above. He admired how the Germans, Italians and Russians were getting things done. In 1932 he proposed calling his revolutionary movement "enlightened Nazism" or "liberal fascism."
In overtime No. 4, Stanford went up by five points and had a few chances to stretch it to eight. But this game couldn<U+2019>t end in such an anticlimactic way. The Beavers fought back to make it 100-99 on two free throws by Jared Cunningham.

In the close quarters of the car, Margaret's body becomes an instrument of violence. She arches her back and slams her 180-pound body against the seat so hard I brace myself for impact. Auburn hair disheveled, lovely hazel eyes hidden behind screwed-up eyelids, she's kicking with her feet, grabbing with her hands for the sunshade, the glove box, the windshield -- anything she can reach. She's ramming her elbow against the window again and again. My sister is fighting the invisible, the unknown, the untellable enemy.

But basically he was a straight baseball detail man, with an unconsciously unique style. Who can ever forget it: "There's a hot smash toward third. Keltner comes up with the throw to first. He's out," Or, "It's a h-i-g-h popper." The way he said it you knew it was really high.
"I think Jerry Reese and the coaches and the owners, they've been studying all the receivers, whether it's rookie receivers in the draft or free agents who are available and what might happen. So I think they're on top of it," Mannning said. "They know we have some good receivers here, some young guys who can play football for us, but that we might need a No. 1 receiver. So I think that's what they're going to look for right now and I'm sure something will happen either during the draft or before the draft or right near it to help us out."

Q: I'm looking for a recipe that was originally published in the late 1970s or early 1980s in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Sunday magazine section ( I think it was called Pictures at that time).

So, conserving state budget money was in fact part of what led to SB 5. Agreed, the bill may be a blunderbuss when a Derringer would have done.

But the issue is spending -- or would be, if Republicans hadn't let their enemies define the debate.

Though it is neither hypocritical nor intrusive for the United States to remind the Afghan government of that fact, the bigger question now is whether moral pronouncements from American officials will hold much sway.

You might smear in some patches of green lawn, with hose sprinkling them: it will remind you that bringing water in by pipeline is still the outstanding accomplishment of man in this region.

Here's a clue: Upholstery staples come in boxes of 10,000 . . . and I suspect the folks at Select Upholstery buy 'em by the gross. When Rob Perkins, a third-generation upholsterer, got busy with the compressed-air-powered stapler, it sounded like an M-16 chatting away on rock 'n' roll.

But no one has brought forth such a change. So although I admire the honesty of Tvert's amendment and don't think it would greatly expand current usage of marijuana, I am certain it would create a confusing second system for regulating the drug. Is marijuana medicinal or recreational? Understanding that Percocet is used both ways does not make me any more likely to support over-the-counter sales of it at my neighborhood liquor store.
From there, the creative process exploded.

Yet his lieutenant governor, Mary Taylor, has been saying another thing, showing outright contempt for the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And since Taylor also heads the Ohio Department of Insurance, she has the responsibility to set up a new state insurance marketplace where Ohioans can shop -- mostly online -- for health coverage and apply for financial help to pay.
For EVs to enter the mainstream, the auto industry has to reach beyond enthusiasts like Kramer and Lefkowitz and appeal to a mass audience. The potential market is huge: Last year, Americans bought 11.6 million new cars and light trucks, and some analysts project sales of 16.3 million in 2015. If EVs can capture even a modest slice of that market, experts say, they could reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.

Manager Mike Matheny was one of several officials who told Stock that his best route to the majors was on the mound, not behind the plate. The timing may have been surprise. The solution shouldn't have been.

Of the oil that we do import, roughly 40 percent of it is imported from our North American neighbors Canada and Mexico. Twelve percent is from Saudi Arabia. The rest from other OPEC members. None from Iran. (DOE Nov. 2011). We are working toward energy independence but still it's a world market and we will not affect the market price or the gasoline price by drilling more.

With worldwide attention now on the caves and tourism a top government priority, cave and resort developer Truong Thinh's vision of another Phuket in sleepy Quang Binh province doesn't seem as risky as when he first proposed it in 2002. About six years ago, he opened the 234-room Sun Spa Resort and more recently completed 34-beachside villas that command prices more commonly found in top Asian beach destinations. We paid a little more than $100 a night, offseason, for an unremarkable room with no ocean view. It's not a bargain by Vietnam standards, but there are not many other options in Dong Hoi.

Ameren says the proposed landfill would meet the anticipated federal standards. That material will be stored dry, not in a sludge pond, with just enough water added to make the ash harden like concrete. It will be protected by multiple liners and a leachate collection system to contain any leaks.

"I don't think it's going to be as much fun as 2000 and 2008," Jim Downey, the show's inimitable satirist, told me. "When you have an incumbent president, it's not wholly new. And because of the long Republican primary debate stretch, I'm already tired of Romney. I wish there could be a crazy brokered convention with someone we've never heard of to keep it fresh. But you don't get a gift like Sarah Palin very often, and I'm sure it'll never happen again."

Jones a fifth-round Sox draft pick in 2007, possesses a mid-90s fastball and for several years the highest-rated curve in the organization. His 15 strikeouts rank among the leaders in the Cactus League and are tied with Chris Sale for the team lead. Jones is the mix, but probably not at the top of the list to make the team.
Back around 1998, I was a server at our fish fry at St. Mary's in Bedford. As I made my rounds to the tables offering coffee and hot water for tea, I came across a pleasant elderly lady who would always ask for tea. Every week without fail she would also say: "Young man, do you have any honey for my tea?" My response was, "No, unfortunately we only offer packets of sugar." This went on for about three weeks, until -- determined to make her day -- I brought some of my own and waited until she asked again. When she did, I responded, "Of course I do!" and proceeded to pull the honey out from my suit coat breast pocket. The name of the lady is lost in time. The favor I did for her was a small one. But the smile on her face and the delight it brought her will live with me forever. -- Stephen J. Zaborszki, Northfield Center

The findings come from a pilot project at Eastbank Hatchery in Wenatchee, Wash., carried out by Chelan County Public Utility District, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Conservation Fund's Freshwater Institute. Researchers determined that fish raised in circular tanks migrated downstream faster upon release, reaching a checkpoint five days earlier than their brethren. More of them survived, as well -- 72 percent compared to 52 percent of fish raised in rectangular tanks, according to a Freshwater Institute news release. Also, the fish raised in circular tanks included fewer "mini-jacks," juvenile salmon that become sexually mature early and stay in freshwater rivers instead of migrating to the ocean. Researchers are concerned that hatchery-raised jack salmon can distort the genetic makeup of wild salmon over time.

It's a nice roster, and it goes 10 players deep. Other than Hibbert, none of them crack the top 10 at their position -- not even Danny Granger, who is having his worst season. But the Pacers will be a tough out, because they excel in the three areas (they rebound, they defend, they shoot 3s) that translate to postseason success.

Hey, Rory: Obviously, the NFL trend is more multiple-receiver formations, but I don't necessarily see more shotgun spread offense like in the college game. Pro coaches want their quarterbacks to throw from the pocket. All the NFL rules favor the passing game, though, so variations of the passing game are going to be exploited by the good coaches until defenses can catch up. Ultimately, the trend will revert to the running game. All these trends are cyclical.

Technology, meanwhile, had always fascinated him. At 16, he launched his first business, a desktop publishing service that created business cards.

Two melancholy Danes share center stage in <U+201C>Flame & Citron,<U+201D> a fascinating film by Ole Christian Madsen, but neither one of them is Hamlet.

The temptation will be to make the new version -- starring Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessice Biel -- bigger and splashier, with over-the-top special effects. And judging by the trailer that's where it's headed. But one of the most appealing aspects of the original was that it was relatively simple, at least for science fiction. It left a lot to the viewer's imagination, which was appropriate for a mind-bending movie born from a short story.

Neil Diamond got his start in the 1960s writing songs that were hits for others including the Monkees ("I'm a Believer," "A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You"). But after collecting his first hit, "Solitary Man," in 1966, the glass-beaded, arena-packing headliner from New York City has become one of the best selling recording artists of all time.

Volkswagen. My orange '74 Westfalia, purchased for $500, now has maybe 10 times that sunk into it. I took it to Doheny several times a year until 2008, when I sold it to get rid of some of my "stuff." Crazy notion, I know.

The problem for economists is that the crisis has, to some extent, reaffirmed this dour and previously discredited view. Prolonged prosperity from 1983 to 2007 bred bad habits and overconfidence. This does not mean that we know nothing or that we have no tools to combat savage recessions; after all, we did avoid a second Great Depression. But it does mean that one promise of modern economics -- to extend economic expansions and shorten slumps -- can create the conditions for its own failure. Although the conclusion is obvious, economists ignore it. The most likely reason is that it undermines their self-appointed role as agents of social progress.
Overall, this course can require a lot of gear-shifting. Newer riders may wonder: When is the best time to shift? The short answer is, before you really need to.

It's possible to create a properly balanced Champagne that doesn't include added sugar at all. But most of the time, simply reducing the level of dosage on an existing brut cuv<U+00E9>e doesn't work; the balance of the wine is lost.

However, one outrageous and baseless claim that cannot go unchallenged is that Coach Paterno knew about a 1998 incident involving Jerry Sandusky that was investigated by local law enforcement.

Getting the beans right is the hardest part, in my opinion. On the Central Coast we use these small, pink beans called piquintos. If you can't find them, use pinto beans. Jerry fudges the whole thing by mixing equal parts of canned pork and beans and something simply called Ranch Beans.

I asked the caterer for the recipe and he looked at me like I'd asked to deflower his daughter. Anyway, Annie, Lompoc High '75, got the following recipe years ago from the Dutra family, which has farmed and ranched around Lompoc for decades.

Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show <U+201C>Father Knows Best<U+201D> took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, <U+201C>This will be cool; everyone will think it<U+2019>s their Springfield.<U+201D> And they do.

Newcomers this week: Arizona, Drexel, N.C. State, Texas
This small, loud, top-notch restaurant, younger sibling to the Hungry Cat in Hollywood, opened in April. It won't be cheap, and you may have to wait, and you might catch a whiff of attitude. But if your dinner is like mine, great-food glee will obliterate just about all else. The almost-all-seafood menu depends heavily on the local catch and changes often. On the weeknight of my visit, the place -- which opens only for dinner and weekend brunches and does not take reservations -- was so packed (and loud) with trendy Santa Barbarians at 6:45 that we were lucky to grab two seats at the copper-topped bar. (I also made room for one of their cocktails, which draw heavily on fresh-squeezed fruit.) Dinner entrees from $9.

Prior to implementing Prodagio AP, Dean Foods was manually processing about 1M invoices per year across 100 locations and making payments by check to nearly 200,000 vendors. Recognizing the drag these manual processes caused, Dean Foods knew it was time for a change. The leader in invoice technology, Prodagio AP uses patented technology to give clients the ability to automate the processing and approval of any invoice from any source. Prodagio automatically matches PO invoices against any existing PO or ERP system and validates non-PO invoices against a client's business rules or contract terms to ensure compliance while reducing errors and fraud. Prodagio's process fault tracking and dashboard analytics provide real-time visibility to enable better management of cash flow and the client's ability to tap into the value of their AP stream.

This stems from the way St. Louis grew, and it persists, some say, because we like our government small. We like that we can get the mayor, or at least an alderman, on the phone. We like having a town for every lifestyle, that Ballwin is different from Jennings is different from Collinsville.

Three Fishers residents filed the federal lawsuit, in part because they want voters to decide first whether the town should become a traditional city. In May 2010, a group supporting the switch to a traditional city presented the town with 1,700 signatures -- more than enough to put the city question to voters.

Shelved next to the Game Reserve was the 2009 Hestia Chenin Blanc from Washington state's Columbia Valley, priced at $13.99. This also has an interesting label with a raised golden face of Hestia, the goddess of the hearth and the protector of home and family. The Hestia chenin blanc received 92 points from the Wine Enthusiast. Like the Game Reserve, this is a dry chenin blanc, but not bone dry. It also tastes of pineapple and honey but has more citrus notes than the Game Reserve. However, I didn't find it quite as lively and crisp. The Hestia has a 13 percent alcohol level and a dense, syrupy mouthfeel. It also would pair well with flavorful and spicy food.

As the book opens, the temperature drops. Gary's cabin construction starts so rashly late in the season that it belies his and Irene's 30 years up north. Clearly, Gary still is fleeing whatever caused him to stow his Berkeley dissertation. Single-minded as a lunatic, he maroons the pair on the uninhabited island.
The lawsuit, filed under seal in state court in Manhattan, comes about a month after J.C. Penney inked a deal with the company founded by celebrity homemaker Martha Stewart. Under the deal, J.C.

Missouri Synod presidents have no term limits. Sitting in his office last month, Kieschnick did not seem like a man ready to give up the presidency.
If the recovery were to flash serious signs of backsliding, the Fed could revive programs to buy mortgage securities or government debt. It could cut to zero the interest rate paid to banks on money left at the Fed, although there are some technical difficulties raised by such a move, Bernanke said.

Assure him that you will keep him safe through the night, and express confidence that soon, possibly tonight, he will be able to fall asleep right away, and sleep until morning.
The film deftly balances this kind of historical accuracy against expressive artistry, contrasting the dazzling, color-drenched New York of Chico<U+2019>s dreams with the monochrome winter landscape that greets him when he arrives.

In a similar vein, all the candidates feel AB 32, the state's greenhouse-gas bill, should be suspended. Hodges, however, suggested that global warming is a myth, a right-wing article of faith. Chavez seized the opportunity to draw a purple contrast, saying he opposed AB 32 on economic grounds but, at the same time, "I believe in science," a signal to liberals and moderates. Douglas echoed her belief in science while advancing the conservative notion that California, a state in job-killing crisis, should not lead on the environmental front.

In his first four seasons in Baltimore, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, the 18th overall pick in the 2008 NFL draft, was the subject of a similar storyline. Like Manning, the 1st overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft, he was scrutinized by national pigskin pundits and some of his hometown fans.

Many of today's biggest problems seem impossible. The budget, taxes, immigration and unclear rules for the Internet have all languished for a decade because of a failure to find solutions in a partisan and gridlocked world. And yet, in a flash, the president accomplished a tax deal and repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military.

Osama bin Laden, a scion of one of Saudi Arabia's wealthiest families, became the grim apostle of a strain of Islamic radicalism that exalted violence against non-believers, and the leader of a terrorist network that launched repeated attacks in the West, most spectacularly in the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001.
The numbers alone are enough to make me cry - to wonder why - we as African Americans will march en masse over one slain by someone who is not black, and yet sit silent over the hundreds of thousands of us obliterated from this mortal world by someone black like us, like me.

Canadian bacon is usually salted and cured, so the flavor is closer to that of ham than bacon, and at about $4 for a 6- to 8-ounce package, it's thrifty, too. It's also a great choice for weeknight meals because the sweet, succulent meat is already cooked, so it makes a great go-to when you want some savory pork flavor but don't feel like messing with raw pork.

There are, of course, other ways to remove Ohio public officials. One is impeachment, but that moves more slowly than a (pre-global-warming) glacier. Then there's the General Assembly's power to remove judges through a procedure -- perhaps never used -- requiring a two-thirds vote of each legislative house. And Ohio for 99 years has offered voters a complaint-petition-hearing mechanism to remove public officials. Last decade, voters took that route to remove certain school board members in Madison (2005) and Lawrence (2006) counties.

His latest television commercial, in fact, is titled, <U+201C>Angry.<U+201D> It features Strickland squinting and clenching his jaw as he vents to workers that he, too, is frustrated by the economy.

There are, of course, all too many examples of public officials whose behavior has earned well-deserved scorn.

The orchestra writing is atmospheric, favoring color (particularly with percussion) and eerie strings. Kahane's singing style can be pop-flavored with his own emotion-worn-on-the-sleeve lyrics and more coolly classical for Crane's intricate stanzas.

Precipitation and thunderstorms in the West will wind down on Friday as the disturbances of the region push into the Plains. The southern storm of the West will bring an end to the intense heat in the Southern Plains, while frontal boundaries exiting the Rockies move into the Plains as a strengthening warm front. This disturbance will bring moderate rain and thunderstorms to areas from the Upper Midwest through the southern Ohio and Tennessee Valley. There is a slight risk of severe storms with a few possible tornadoes in areas across central and eastern Kansas, far northern and northeastern Oklahoma, into western and central Missouri. In the East, low pressure will lift across New England with rain showers and chances of thunderstorms as it progresses into southeastern Canada. Winds circulating around this system will spread a cooler airmass across the region, setting the stage for possible snow development across the area. To the south of this system, an associated cold front will trail through the Mid-Atlantic and cross the northern tier of the Southeast with chances of isolated showers and thunderstorms.

"Guy Noir and the Straight Skinny" is Keillor's first book featuring beleaguered private dick Guy Noir, a satirical Sam Spade-type protagonist based in St. Paul whose "Guy Noir: Private Eye" segments on "PHC" have become an audience favorite. In the scatological plot of "The Straight Skinny," Noir's femme fatale business partner gives him a diet pill that deposits tapeworms in the stomach of the dieter. Noir acts as a guinea pig for the pills and becomes svelte and sexy enough to have young women on both sides of the Mississippi throwing themselves his way. Gangsters and the FDA get wind of what Noir is up to and everyone wants a piece of the action -- and a piece of Noir.

The two strands of the novel, the daughters' voices, are not woven, which might seem too simple but their characters bump into each other, setting in motion the plot.

Dana accidentally meets Chaurisse when both girls are 14, after Atlanta's science fair. Both girls are wearing waist-length rabbit fur coats <U+2014> but Dana knows this is not coincidental.

Corticosteroids are not the same as the anabolic steroids that are sometimes used to enhance athletic performance.

Cortisone has proven to be an effective therapy for these and other disorders that cause joint and back pain, often providing symptom relief for weeks or months after injection into the affected joint or area.

9. The Best Man (1964): Gore Vidal wrote the play, and screenplay, about a presidential primary that fails to nominate a candidate on the first ballot, so the in-fighting begins.

But I was the only one to brave the tubeless green slide, a superfast ride that you go down lying flat on your back. Children who are too short for the big slides can use a third slide; however, it may seem too small for kids older than 6.

You know, it's not a bad place. I hear they even have a football team, though you wouldn't know it by this movie.

Dredgers help clean the riverbed of steel and lead shot, lures, hooks, lines and sinkers.

And it's getting worse. In July, the interest rate on U.S. government-sponsored student loans is scheduled to double to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent. This will add thousands to the debt owed by today's students, and to the cost of repaying that debt over time. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) has prepared legislation that would extend the 3.4 percent rate, paying for it by ending top end tax breaks - including those on corporate jets.

One of the Democratic proposals that most concerns insurers is the creation of a "public option" insurance plan. The industry launched a campaign on Capitol Hill against it, grounded in a study published by the Lewin Group, a health policy consulting firm that is owned by UnitedHealth Group.

It's great, because to me, being busy is the best thing in the world.
I always hate it when the artist gets in the apparatus suspended by wires over the crowd. It happens at most arena shows, and I always have the same reaction: what if the wires snap? The spectacle is never worth the anxiety. I had extra special levels of anxiety during the final encore, because if there is one artist I do not want to see fall to her death in the middle of the Prudential Center, that artist is Taylor Swift. I don't think I could handle that. Sure enough, no sooner is Swift up and over the crowd than the cradle begins to rock. Steely pop warrior she is, she only looks terrified for a split-second. She puts her hand on the rail of the balcony, as if to steady it, which is of course impossible, because she's thirty feet off the ground. The crew gets her out of there quick, but at an inopportune time -- Swift keeps on singing, but she's in the pit and running to get onstage for the song's climax. I'm not disappointed. I am happy to see that Taylor Swift is not the sort of woman who is ready to die for her art. I wasn't sure about that.

"They can be very patchy in their distribution," said Rob Lawrence, a forest entomologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation. "One thing to consider is what was the tree cover and forest like in that area 13 years ago, or two or three generations ago? This particular brood, each time it emerges, they're looking for trees to deposit their eggs in. If you're in an area that is a new subdivision, if all the trees were cleared, that would have killed off the cicada underground because they feed on the sap from tree roots."

The post-9/11 enhancements won't make high-rises or other buildings terrorism-proof, experts stress. A determined assailant, armed with enough firepower, can overwhelm the sturdiest structure.

Modern Puerto Escondido has come into its own in the past decade, offering moderate prices, good food, a wide range of restaurants and hotels, and just enough nightlife.

Of course, the humor and appeal of "Forbidden" wouldn't go far merely by adding new comedic lyrics to old standards or mocking how musical theater stars (and the characters they play) look, act and sing.

Not one big thing, it will be how everything works together. It will be a ticket-less, cashless building, a building that is smarter than anything else that has been there. You have a home entertainment experience now and some people think it's better than actually being at the game. We want to make sure your experience at the stadium is better than anywhere, you can't possibly have a better experience.

"I think the sad truth is those kids were used to being able to bully Alex largely without consequence," Hirsch says. "At one point during that school year, $15 was stolen from a teacher. It was like a five-alarm fire. There were police cars, principals running up and down the hallway. The kids got a very clear message that stealing was not OK. That sort of reaction never happened around bullying. I think those signals, those signs are very well interpreted by the students. I wasn't an authority figure, but I don't know if they were that particularly scared of bullying around authority figures either."

As a runner, I was better prepared for the lunge series that came next.

I'm not sold on Jason Hammel. He's off to an incredible start, especially at homer-friendly Camden Yards, but two of those starts were against the Blue Jays. Hammel always had middling numbers in ERA (4.63) and WHIP (1.403) over three full seasons in Colorado, but his strikeout rate dipped from 7.1 K/9 in 2010 to 5.0 in 2011. Whether his early success is due to the move to the AL or improvement in velocity remains to be seen. I wouldn't start him this week with games at the Yankees and Red Sox. And, oh yeah, Baltimore still has 51 games to play against those Yankees and Red Sox, not to mention the Rays.

Cities differ markedly in how tightly their borders are drawn around their inner core, and how much of outlying areas are included within city limits can have a big effect on crime levels. The rankings are based only on reported crime, and reporting rates vary, criminologists say. Also, personal safety varies tremendously depending on lifestyle, income and neighborhood.

For Mr. Gingrich, it's his endless know-it-all posturing, sense of self-importance and grandiosity that, as Mr. Santorum might say, makes you want to throw up.

Harvey Weinstein, of all people, once told me that as a younger man he'd snuck behind the scenes of a major magician's stage show and figured out how all the big, elaborate tricks and illusions were done. He was driven to find out the answers, but once he knew them, he felt let down.

Still, who else in the wide-open Republican field can generate so much buzz? Who else inspires such visceral, inchoate devotion? Among her fans -- the kind of folks who would flood the Iowa caucuses in the winter of 2012 -- she is essentially critic-proof, much like a badly-written best-selling pulp novel. The more she is attacked for lack of substance, the more they love her. The more she is successfully fact-checked by the "elite," the tighter the ties with those who feel similarly aggrieved.

I quickly set up the family beachhead, jammed the Christmas tree in the sand and bee lined toward the surf. After riding a couple of small, clean waves, I spotted an impressive set wave forming on the horizon. The wave was quickly becoming a large turquoise wall of rolling energy. I paddled hard to catch the rising ramp, challenged by the offshore breeze rippling the wave face. As I lifted my chest off the board and rose to my feet, I noticed a tanned surfer in trunks on a very long board stroking for the same wave.

There are pieces on aging and bald spots; the book opens with two riffs on memory loss. They're not terrible, but they feel rattled off, as if Arianna Huffington (indeed, "The D Word," one of the book's original pieces, kicked off a new Huffington Post section on divorce) or some other big-name editor had said, "Whatever you want to write, I'm sure it will be great" and Ephron, in between, one hopes, screenplays and other facets of her very busy life, said, "Sure, here's 800 words." Eight hundred words that may be better than the average <U+2014> heck, most any <U+2014> blogger could conjure. But you're not any blogger. You're Nora Ephron.

Beinart's habit of what is either inexplicable sloppiness or extreme interpretative elasticity turns out to be one of the defining characteristics of The Crisis of Zionism. In fact, one of the challenges of reviewing the book is that it practically demands a typology. Consider a few examples:

Perhaps conservative pundits couldn't stand the fact that Obama called them out explicitly. "I'd just remind conservative commentators," he said, "that for years what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint -- that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law. Well, this is a good example." Yes, it is.

9. One sincere question I have about Matheny: is he creative? As a catcher he was resolute in following the careful game plan for attacking hitters as devised by pitching coach Dave Duncan. Matheny never deviated much by adding his own touches. (Which makes him different from Yadier Molina, who will go his own way and make adjustments when picking up on something.) As manager, La Russa often thought outside the box. No one will be quite as creative as TLR, and we wouldn't expect Matheny to step in and be unconventional. But it will be interesting to watch Matheny grow and develop as a manager; a personality will emerge. I'm just not sure what to expect. Like La Russa, Matheny will be be tough-minded, and he'll try to be a strong leader. Other than that, the scouting report is blank. Matheny has a lot to prove. Will he be his own man? If it's believed that Mozeliak is pulling Matheny's strings, the young manager will lose credibility.
Since collecting follicles one by one directly from the scalp is so time-consuming and difficult, physicians that do it charge $5,000 to $10,000, Harris says. The robot cost $200,000, but because it saves him time, Harris offers patients a discount if they let ARTAS do the follicle extraction.

The framework for Maryland's exchange has already been created, and supporters say its impact on the local economy, as well as individuals' health, is certain. About 700,000 Marylanders, or 13 percent, are uninsured, and officials expect at least half to gain some kind of coverage. That would save the state about $1 billion over a decade.

That's what British historian Ronald Wright calls a "progress trap." It's a crisis that occurs when innovators deplete the very elements that allowed them to initially advance, like parasites killing off their host. The accessible, visually striking and lucidly reasoned "Surviving Progress" argues that civilization is now at such a brink, like the Sumerians, Mayans and Easter Islanders of old. "Unlimited economic progress in a world of finite natural resources doesn't make sense. It's bound to collapse," says naturalist Jane Goodall.

And although Hugh Grant is the supposed draw as the dully named Captain Pirate, he's all wrong for the part. The point is that the buccaneer is a bit of a fop.

A: I think it's more of a case of caveat emptor. When buying tickets for late-season games you either have the chance to see teams desperately fight for playoff position or rest their stars once already locked in.

If you have ornamental grasses in your yard, such as certain Muhlenbergia species or grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.), cut back to the ground to rejuvenate.

Deciduous trees can be reduced and thinned around mid-month.

Now, I've never met Maroulis, but I've heard of her legend. She's a three-time U.S. Open champion, and was the top seed at 55 kilograms in the trials. Campbell had never beaten her, and as she said, "There wasn't any reason for the average Joe to think I'd upset the No. 1 seed."

A. Think of an arthritis flare as a looming thunderstorm and yourself as a runner. If you could almost feel electricity crackling through the air, instead of risking getting zapped by a lightning bolt, you'd switch to plan B. For a runner, that might be a treadmill.

The metal of the countertop was still hot from service. Everyone got a glass for wine from the half-empty bottles left over from the dining room, and after 13 hours came the final push of the night: the menu meeting.

She gave us the name and phone number of the man at the hotel who could make arrangements for us.

COLUMBUS -- Before the latest TV commercial railing against the statewide casino ballot issue even reached the airwaves in late September, it had touched off a firestorm of controversy behind the scenes between supporters and opponents of the gambling proposal.
So in that spirit, I will wait and see. Yes, I was in a fraternity when "Animal House" was released in 1978, and it remains one of my favorite movies. It was co-written by honorary St. Louisan Harold Ramis and partly based on incidents at Washington U. and my alma mater the University of Southern California. But the dudes from the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies are writing the score for the new play, and the director is from the Tony-winning musical "The Book of Mormon." That's a good start.
Group-sales events like this are a part of the business model that has kept Harvey's going, Kolin says. "Our customer base is all over the state. We have people coming up from Grants Pass ... all up the I-5 corridor." Kolin believes in promotions, and regularly offers free tickets to get people in who may not have visited a comedy club before. Harvey's is unpretentious, Kolin says, adding that his audiences come from "outlying areas, they come in from Salem, Washougal, Gresham, Beaverton. The Pearl isn't coming to Harvey's. We do a ton of bachelorette parties in the summertime, and lots of turning-21 parties."

<U+201C>But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin,<U+201D> said Obama. <U+201C>If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.

"Here's the secret," she said when asked about her long life. "I have a good attitude. I'm not a worrier. I do worry, but I'm not a worrier. There's a difference. I've never had the stress of children. I like children, but I never had my own. I have a lot of friends! The trick to having friends is to be a friend. My church is very important to me, and I've done a lot of volunteer work for the church over the years. My friends from church are my family."

Portland already is home to the TNT cable series "Leverage," and the quirky IFC cable comedy "Portlandia." What sets "Grimm" apart is that it's on a major broadcast network -- which reaches a broader audience -- and not only films but is set in Portland.
For Big Science types at APL, tilting too far to their logical, self-controlled left brains could be hazardous. But that<U+2019>s less of an issue since the curtain was raised on the APL Drama Club by mission designer Chris Dong and fellow space department member Dawn Moessner, a mission design analyst.
Denton is also shrewd enough to take note of the class factor that Greg Mitchell highlighted in his account of the 1950 senatorial campaign, "Tricky Dick and the Pink Lady." Chotiner was at pains to contrast not only Nixon's staunch anti-communism with Douglas' suddenly suspect liberalism but also the difference between Pat Nixon and the Democratic nominee -- "suburban housewife versus clawing professional. While Pat was the quintessential homemaker, keeping the hearth fires burning for the family, Helen was the ruthless elitist who had abandoned her children and husband in her unwomanly ambition and grasp for power."
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. -- Faced with decade-low natural gas prices that have made some drilling operations unprofitable, Chesapeake Energy Corp. says that it will drastically cut drilling and production of the fuel in the U.S.
The state currently requires licenses, which must be renewed every two years, and inspections for all adult day care centers.

"I am in a very blessed position because the people who read my novels range in age from 10 years old to 100. When I sit down to write a novel, the first question I decide is 'What are the ages of the characters who are falling in love?' Because that will inform dilemma," Sparks says. "People enjoy books about people their own age because they can relate to them.

Although the Champions announced weeks ago that they plan to sue FAMU, that lawsuit will have to wait about six months because the university is a state institution.
Last year, chef Nei' opened a less expensive place called Flying Pan Bistro on Clay Street just east of Kearny. It didn't fly, so he moved Jai Yun there, almost tripling the space of the original. It's a much nicer setting, like any number of pleasant, inexpensive Chinese restaurants, with flower-painted umbrellas hanging off the mezzanine, red wainscoting and generic Chinese screens and art on the wall. The only nods to luxury are the plates and the large white tumblers for tea.
South Korean customs officials have refused to say where the dead babies came from or who made the capsules, citing possible diplomatic friction with Beijing.

In November, an earlier version of the business plan estimated that it would cost more than $98 billion to build a 520-mile line of dedicated, electrified tracks that would be used only by high-speed trains from downtown San Francisco to downtown Los Angeles and on to Anaheim. The plan approved Thursday lops about $30 billion off that price tag. At $68.4 billion, the new version realizes most of its savings by calling for a "blended system" in which high-speed trains would share tracks or right-of-way now used by commuter trains in the Bay Area and Los Angeles Basin.
MF: I don't see how we can maintain a decent society if we have a world split into haves and have-nots, with the haves subsidizing the have-nots. In our current educational system, close to 30 percent of the youngsters who start high school never finish. They are condemned to low-income jobs. They are condemned to a situation in which they are going to be at the bottom. That leads in turn to a divisive society; it leads to a stratified society rather than one of general cooperation and general understanding. The effective literacy rate in the United States today is almost surely less than it was 100 years ago. Before government had any involvement in education, the majority of youngsters were schooled, literate and able to learn. It is a disgrace that in a country like the United States, 30 percent of youngsters never graduate from high school. And I haven't even mentioned those who drop out in elementary school. It's a disgrace that there are so many people who can't read and write. It's hard for me to see how we can continue to maintain a decent and free society if a large subsection of that society is condemned to poverty and to handouts.

He starts off the article with this great quote from Frederick Engels, the father of Marxist theory, from a letter to a friend in 1851: "That you are going to America is bad, but I really don't know what other advice to give you. <U+2026> Outside of New York, the only endurable place is St. Louis."
Ohio's pilot program, launched in 2007, hit its cap at $120 million in credits in 2008. A bipartisan stimulus package passed in mid-2008 allocated $60 million each fiscal year - carrying the state through its last round of awards, announced in June 2010.

I put that question to readers of my blog when your case first came to my attention. Some felt that the hotel wasn't responsible for what appeared to be a regional power outage. Others indicated that a hotel like the Holiday Inn should have had a backup generator and was contractually obligated to provide services such as heat, electricity, hot water and breakfast.
It's time - way past time, actually - for this fiscal insanity to end. If an owner such as Atlanta's Arthur Blank (estimated net worth: $1.3 billion) wants a new stadium, he needs to pull out his checkbook and pay for it himself.

On April 17, I will be protesting war taxes at Baltimore's main post office. I realize that taxes fund many good programs <U+2014> education, environment and diplomacy.

Remove the bowl from the water bath, and attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment. Beat the mixture on high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form and the meringue has cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low, and whisk in the soft butter in small increments. Make sure each addition of butter is completely incorporated into the meringue before adding more butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula if necessary. Once all the butter is incorporated (about 10 minutes), adjust the mixer to medium-high speed. Continue to beat for a few more minutes or until the buttercream is light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes.

But, perhaps, political observes need not look beyond Lake County in Northeast Ohio.

Notes: McMillan said he was leaning toward featuring a small lineup against the Rockets, with Batum playing small forward and Aldridge playing center. ... The Spurs shot 51.4 percent, but won despite committing 23 turnovers and even though they got just seven points and nine rebounds from Tim Duncan. ... Batum finished with seven points in just over 22 minutes off the bench. ... The Spurs improved to 8-0 at home.

Each evening, Hope and her family spent time chatting with O'Neill and his team. Finally, Hope told O'Neill that if Hansen was out of contention, she'd switch her allegiance to his colt. And that's how it played out as the seventh-grader cheered on I'll Have Another.
But a close look at the U.S. solar industry suggests that the tariffs may actually be a job killer because the vast majority of positions in the sector aren't on the assembly line. Instead, upward of 70% of U.S. solar employment is in installation, sales and distribution <U+2014> and companies that hire those workers argue solar cells must get significantly cheaper to remain competitive with other energy sources.

Hey, Steve: I wouldn't characterize anyone in the contract dispute as a villain. The sides disagree on the value of Hillis. It happens. Rather than choose a side, everyone should just let the business of football run its course. Hillis is under contract through this season. He knows that it behooves everyone -- himself and the Browns -- for him to make the most of the remaining 10 games.
It's fine to be outraged that a breast cancer foundation stops sending a paltry amount to the nation's largest provider of abortions. But apparently it's not acceptable for a church leader to fight for religious freedom and freedom of conscience on an issue that is fundamental to Church teachings.

There may have been more effective choices out there given the need to foster new interest. For example, Janacek has been very popular in New York -- could NYCO have taken on his immensely powerful "Jenufa?" Could the musical theater crowd have been drawn in better by a time-tested genre-bender like Bernstein's "Candide?"

McAndrew said great strides have been made in recent years to heighten awareness about patient privacy.
But most baseball players caught in the steroids web are dense, na<U+00EF>ve and arrogant. Slugger Manny Ramirez just flunked a second drug test and retired in shame; he didn't learn a damned thing. Understand that athletes that are determined to cheat and gain an unfair advantage never seem to think that they'll be discovered. And they'll keep trying to rig the system. This Bonds business won't alter that. Again: this case wasn't about doping; it was about telling lies.
"He'd charge up his father-in-law's wheelchair and ride it door-to-door and see if people would talk to him," Merz said.

"I'd like to go talk to Balash about it," he said. "I don't feel I did anything wrong. Any replay that shows us going into the trioval will show the splitter smoking (from the tire going flat).

I don't understand how she thinks anyone would do that on purpose, but I don't know."
In Pennsylvania, the heat caused by the high-speed crash into a field caused 92 percent of the human remains to vaporize, leaving very little to work with, said Wallace Miller, the county corner who helped to identify the victims.

There are many reasons Dickens translates so well to the screen.

I am enormously grateful to our parents and talented educators, but I sense that this fundraising flies under the radar for those without school-age children.

President's Day weekend seemed to be a turning point for gasoline prices, which look to be increasing faster than a speeding bullet. If the trend continues, analysts say, we may see $5 a gallon and beyond. That will put into play some of the measures that made the gas price run-up of 2008 (in June, gas reached $4.62 a gallon) so painful: taxi cab and shuttle service fuel surcharges, hotel energy surcharges and ever higher air fares. Ouch.

Red sauce not your thing? Try a white sauce -- it's easy to make and is a great start for a number of flavorings. Add caramelized onions, deglazed with a little white wine, or try mushrooms or even spinach.

"That is our All Star and we need to look at that," McMillan said. "If it works, great. If it doesn't, then we've looked at it, and you make adjustments.

Last week, Davis answered questions in front of the council as part of an inquiry into pending criminal charges against County Executive John R. Leopold. Though he had not been subpoenaed, Davis testified under oath.
But he is hardly the only problem. Rudy Fernandez has been invisible during the series, averaging just 2.8 points and 2.0 rebounds while making just three field goals. The Blazers' season-long weakness -- shooting -- continues to sabotage them. And they have been unable to develop any offensive consistency, particularly in Game 5 when the Mavericks' pressure defense disrupted the transition game and their zone defense stymied the Blazers' halfcourt flow. Oh, there also was that little rebounding problem, too.
Who can blame them? After all, with Guillen gone, everyone is happy. Williams finally gets to be the face of the franchise, a position he long has coveted but couldn't have under the huge shadow left by Guillen.

<U+2014>CANADA imported 191,047 metric tons of U.S. beef in 2011, a 25 percent increase over 2010. (One metric ton equals nearly 2,205 pounds). It was worth $1.03 billion, up 41 percent from 2010. Canada was the first of the United States' major trading partners to say Tuesday that it was confident in the U.S. food safety system and would not limit imports because of the mad cow case.

With Axelrod surely behind the gambit, a cynic could argue that having one man wear two hats is efficient. But the White House doesn<U+2019>t even have to make that fatuous claim because the press doesn<U+2019>t question Axelrod<U+2019>s dual role.

Van Voris and Hunter have good chemistry as a married couple, and each delivers, as usual, a wonderful performance (Van Voris<U+2019> pole dance is brief but not to be missed). De Groat, who begins the production in turquoise leggings (a nice expression of character by costumer Ashton Edmonds) and works her way up the brightness scale from there, is a delight. She plays her ditzy, live-in-the-moment character with great skill.

Subjugation of women, mistreatment verbally and physically is a predicament for the whole human race, no matter what the faith or ethnic origin is. Denying a Muslim woman education or working outside the home is not dictated by Islam but a cultural practice albeit wrong one. This should not automatically label the dress of those women or their interaction with the society as being "oppressed".

The reversal of the decision comes two weeks after the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, the government agency responsible for the overhaul of Atlantic City<U+2019>s troubled gaming and entertainment districts, unveiled a master plan for a newly defined tourism district. At the same meeting, Catanoso<U+2019>s comments about the return of the diving horses generated much buzz.
The script isn't as strong. For instance, a scene in which Miller and Olivier drink and talk should have been electric -- two geniuses swapping stories -- but instead it is perfunctory, almost clich<U+00E9>d. Scenes between Clark and Olivier fare better; Olivier is comfortable enough around Clark to talk about his frustrations, at one point telling his charge that directing a film is the best job in the world, and that after working with Monroe he'll never do it again. (And he didn't, at least not until 1970, when he directed "Three Sisters").
The study, paid for by the National Institutes of Health and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, eclipsed the news released this summer of a vaginal microbicide that reduced infections in women.

Maybe that's why the 1912 convention proposed, and voters ratified, a constitutional amendment that empowers the legislature to "provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the state." Too bad today's Republican-led General Assembly snubs "the people" and sweet-talks the very monopolies T.R. despised.

"If the robot is used in inexperienced hands," Eun said, "it can be a really dangerous weapon." Without proper training, he added, using the robot can be disorienting.

The best way to do that, and to share the information with your descendants, is to create what is known as a family health tree.

Those were accusations that hurt her. The 1980s weren't the so-called "post-racial" moment of now. (The "post-racial" moment doesn't actually exist for black women.

Whitney was one of the first artists to integrate MTV. She thought she was bringing her people forward - to be called a "sellout" was a horrible insult.

Wendell Maxey: Earl Barron is one of those 10-day contract guys Portland has had their eye on for a while now and were fortunate to sign for the rest of the season. But he still falls into the "not really sure what to make of his game until we see significant run" category. Even still, you almost have to dig Earl for his size alone and ability to mix in on both ends of the floor. Plus Barron has an NBA title to boast, so he's got that going for him.

I do a lot of running up the middle, I take a lot of shots, and I break a lot of tackles. I do a lot of different things that nobody seems to take note of unless they really know football. I think it's just the perception of Oregon football - we have nice, colorful uniforms and nice shoes.

I'd barely heard of the East Cape when I first visited there five years ago, and the rutted dirt roads nearly voided my rental-car contract. Air-conditioning was a rare luxury; solar and generator power ruled. This rugged area, beginning just north of San Jos<U+00E9> del Cabo and stretching nearly 10 miles along the Sea of Cort<U+00E9>s past Los Barilles on the way to La Paz, remained for decades a secret fishing and diving playground. Snorkeling, kayaking, surfing and windsurfing have entered the mix, while hiking, zip-lines and hot springs have earned it ecotourism credentials. Active types and fans of primitive, wide open spaces will still find plenty to love, but be aware that Baja Sur has big plans to turn this region into the Cabo Riviera one day. The paved highway, making its way south from La Ribera, will eventually run all the way to the Los Cabos airport.

Haskin wished the DNR had taken him seriously, he said, because once the bear crossed the interstate, it went into a plowed field and would have left tell-tale paw prints.

Driving the GOP effort is a desire to avert a $55 billion cut<U+2014>about 10 percent<U+2014>to the Pentagon budget and a $43 billion cut to domestic agencies starting Jan. 1. There's bipartisan opposition to this so-called sequester, but it's not at all clear what part the cuts proposed by Republicans will play in any ultimate solution. Many budget observers believe any solution to the sequester, as well as what to do about the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts at the same time, will be postponed until after the November election.
"I think that's why a lot of the (football) schools have departed because they're carrying the show and too many people with the round ball are making the decisions," O'Leary said a few days ago on his weekly radio show. "People think the Big East is a basketball conference, but it's driven by football money, which is why it's ridiculous for the football-basketball combo schools to put up with what's been going on."
As a way of energizing the Republican base, there's some talk in Columbus of larding up the November ballot with votes on various social issues. That would be a bad thing -- and might just backfire.

Notes: Joe Burton replaced Eric Moreland in the starting lineup. The Beavers went with the same five who started the first 14 games of the season, and the first two Pac-12 games: Starks, Cunningham, Burton, Devon Collier and Angus Brandt. <U+2026> It was the Beavers<U+2019> biggest comeback (10 points down) of the season <U+2013> they trailed by eight against Texas before winning 100-95 in overtime. <U+2026> The 23 first-half points were a season low; the 53 second-half points was one shy of the second-half outburst in the win over California at Gill Coliseum. <U+2026> In the 336th Civil War, Cunningham became the 36th OSU player to score 1,000 career points.

Balla has the curiosity of a small child as he shows interested diners through his storage area, where he hangs his salumi, shelves his extensive collection of house-made vegetable pickles and points to dozens of jars of various chiles he dries and buys. In fact, last summer Balla says he bought 3,000 pounds and now it's almost gone. He also has about 100 house-cured spices and powders, and he's always experimenting with something new (see Janny Hu's feature on Balla, sfg.ly/zkRWfX).
... I walked down to Union Square. It was filled with people -- hardly a square foot unoccupied. White people and negroes and Chinese and Japanese all mixed without prejudice -- one bench in the park might harbor all the chief races and no one seemed to be aware of it. One feeling seemed to possess all of them, and the expression was the same in every one's face -- a dull staring look of resigned despair -- a waiting for the end -- fear -- hopelessness. I never before saw people so cling to one another with a complete surrender of individuality.

Through it is tempting to rehash all the tragedies of this year - significant as they were - today I want to think about what worked well. I took advantage of the warm weather this week and spent the day working outside. That was a gift in itself.

And you have to realize that even if Israel were to receive various security guarantees in a prospective peace deal with the Palestinians, it can have little confidence that those promises would be honored for very long.

The survivors come to Lotta's Fountain and tell their stories of days long ago. "They lived through the rebuilding of San Francisco," said Taren Sapienza, who has organized the earthquake remembrance ceremony for 30 years.
Mary and Joseph did not get to pore over a list of most popular baby names. They did not get to name their firstborn child after a relative or a friend, or worry about what how his name would look on a driver's license or a business card. They name him Jesus because that's what the angel told them his name would be. I wonder how many parents in the 21st century would be okay with having to forfeit the right and the privilege of naming their own child? We tend to see our children as our own, rather than thinking of them as gifts given to us by God. It might surprise or even worry many of us to think that God already has an identity in mind for them, a destiny and a purpose that are more important than our own hopes, plans, and dreams.

Pollen counts in some regions are certainly nothing to sneeze at -- in Raleigh, N.C., for instance, the state Division of Air Quality counted 3,524 particles per cubic meter of air on April 7, up to three times the volume that's typically seen in the spring.
The streak Suarez snapped included convictions and guilty pleas in more than 200 cases. The run dates so long that even veteran prosecutors struggled to recall their last corruption loss, which appears to have come in 1999 when three West New York police officers were acquitted of taking kickbacks.
The mass mailings and early voting operations in Cuyahoga County have reduced the number of Election Day voters, officials said. As a result, lines have been shorter and tabulating votes has been less problematic for the once-beleaguered Cuyahoga board.

Not all of these various lists and marathons are strictly about an entrepreneur starting and running or business. Consider "Field of Dreams" in which Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella plows under productive land to build a baseball field. The message for entrepreneurs isn't "if you build it, they will come." In fact most entrepreneurs realize that cart-before-the-horse approach is a recipe for failure.

The opening of casinos in neighboring Pennsylvania, popular with senior citizen slots players who make up a good portion of Resorts' customer base, hurt even more. When the recession hit, Resorts stopped paying its mortgage.

A: I spoke with a representative from Qwest and they said they do not use any kind of soil sterilant when they bury phone lines. Phone lines are low voltage and, as such, would not emit much of an electromagnetic field. The cable used should be shielded, so if there are any emissions, they should not affect plant growth. Another thought is that the phone company disturbed the layers of soil enough so that there are next to no nutrients in the plants' root zones (top soil, where most of the nutrients exist, is very thin in the Phoenix area). Although not pleasant to contemplate, you might consider removing the top 12 to 18 inches of soil and replace with new topsoil or heavily amend the existing soil with some good organic matter.

While they don't share much on the surface, "Rose" (directed by Rapp) and "Paraffin" (directed by Daniel Aukin) subtly show how a building can actually develop a kind of institutional memory: Someone always has problems paying the rent, someone's always in love with the wrong person, a new artist is always trying to make it.

Revenue from so-called "12b-1" fees can be used for a wide range of fund services beyond upfront sales costs, and an investor can pay the fees for years after they've gotten into a fund, eroding returns. Even industry pros find 12b-1s confusing, because funds can use the fee revenue in so many different ways beyond compensating brokers selling funds.

Back at the Alyeska before bedtime, I sign up for the Northern Lights wake-up call in case they become visible over the resort. I wanted to see the Aurora Borealis in the worse way, but I have no such luck on this trip. So I make the most of daytime activities. I take a spin with a snowmobile (they call them "snow machines" up here), navigating through Chugach mountain valleys and around gold mines and creeks. On days when the snow permits, you can explore ice caves and see icebergs. And I take a "flight-seeing" tour, zooming close (but not too close!) to clear-blue glacial ice and waters.

Mr. Walker's reforms were a modest but necessary response to the state's fiscal problems, and the proof is in the emerging results. The union reaction was so ferocious because the reforms reduced Big Labor's clout over state and local taxpayers and thus its ability to milk taxpayers year after year without challenge.
Republicans planned to make up the loss in tax revenues by borrowing $43.5 million from state budget reserves, a move Dayton and many Democrats said was irresponsible when the state faces a shortfall.

Aleppo bears watching in part because it remains the country's last firm Assad stronghold. Even Damascus, Syria's capital, has become a regular hub of protests, where the opposition has mustered some quiet support from the crucial business and middle classes that traditionally support the Assad regime.

As the service began, an announcement was made regarding the church's then-legendary "Glory of Christmas" pageant. The show, now discontinued because of the Cathedral's financial problems, was a full-featured theatrical production with angel's flying through the air, orchestrated musical numbers, and a cast of hundreds.

But he still had one more card up his pulpit robe. Grinning from ear to ear, he announced that the church was flying in actual shepherd boys from Palestine.

NFC EAST: Yesterday<U+2019>s column was devoted fully to the Eagles, so I won<U+2019>t rehash only to say once again second-round pick Vinny Curry, the defensive end from Marshall by way of Neptune High School, was a real good pick. When the Giants sat at No. 32, they had three players in mind: Virginia Tech running back David Wilson, who they selected; LSU wide receiver Reuben Randle and UConn defensive lineman Kendall Reyes. So when they got to 64 and Randle was still on the board, it was a no-brainer for GM Jerry Reese and his crew. For once, Dallas owner Jerry Jones didn<U+2019>t let his ego get in the way and mess up the team<U+2019>s draft.

By that, I mean at worst Claiborne will be a solid cover corner; at best he becomes an All-Pro. Washington might have become the biggest joke in the league.

Schiano: Joe was, has been a ton, everything to me. He gave me a chance. I was a 25-year-old kid, and he gave me a chance, hired me as a full-time coach at one of the top programs in the country. He certainly gave my career a jumpstart to say the least, and I learned a ton working under him for six years and he's been a mentor of mine. He and Sue and the whole Paterno family have been great to Christy, myself and our family. I know eventually it's going to happen. It's just very, very hard under these circumstances. A lot of hard things. And as I said Monday, I don't think you need a whole lot of people talking about everything that's going on out there. I know it's a very keen subject right now, but I just feel better staying on our (game). I'll be rooting for coach Paterno. Hopefully he has a great end to these next couple of weeks.

Despite the skepticism, after re-reading the draft-guide scouting reports on McClellin, I felt a regret similar to when I look back at the form to see what I missed in the winning horse I failed to consider, let alone put $2 on. Without having seen McClellin even in shorts as a Bear, I'll say this: McClellin is closer to Brian Urlacher than he is to Dan Bazuin. His versatility, size and athleticism make him a better candidate to succeed somewhere on the Bears' defense. When Bazuin failed at defensive end he had nowhere to go. McClellin has options.

The fact is that 75 percent of the roads currently open to street-legal vehicles will remain open. The majority of the roads proposed for closure were already closed by previous Forest Service decisions and are the most poorly maintained in the national forest. The Forest Service can't afford to maintain everything it has, and these roads are already deteriorating at an alarming rate, causing serious and long-term ecological degradation. If the Forest Service establishes a road system it can afford to maintain, then there will be reliable, consistent and accessible roads for the public to use for the long term, and that isn't the case now.

One World Trade Center's construction is vastly more expensive than a traditional office tower, in large part due to security costs associated with building the tallest building in North America on a site that has been the target of two separate terrorist attacks (the site was also bombed in 1993).

They had just finished their most brutal road trip of the season -- a four-game swing Christmas week to Dallas, Phoenix, Sacramento and L.A. to see the Lakers -- at 3-1. Before they won in Phoenix, the Suns were undefeated at home. Before they won in L.A., some were questioning whether the Cavs were even legit title contenders. For those reasons, it felt like they actually went 3.9-1 on the trip.

Perhaps my association of artichokes with beauty began as a child, on the Sunday drives with my grandfather down the coast to Castroville - the self-proclaimed "Artichoke Capital of the World."

"I think that's what we think about here too, the interrelatedness of plants, people and nature," La Rose says.
I do fully agree with you, Katherine, that too much is made out of politicians' parenting abilities, especially women's. I do hold out one exception, though -- politicians who support intrusive government action on our home lives should be held to the very standards they'd impose by law on the rest of us. If the words "sanctity of life" or "sanctity of marriage" ever pass between your lips, I consider that an open invitation for the citizenry to file through your underwear drawer and follow you into any airport bathroom to witness any foot-tapping antics.

This is certainly a pivotal moment in theological education, when seminaries and divinity schools are facing the same strain as all of higher education, with the additional tension of a public square that is conflicted over the role of religion in society.

The old data are often sufficiently complete for us to discover new "laws" of baseball, invent new guidelines for recruiting and managing players, or, in science, to reveal new perspectives on how organisms live, grow and evolve. Yet in far too many cases, fresh scrutiny of old data reveals painful omissions that merely prove science has missed an opportunity.

It has been two years since the Supreme Court issued its decision in the case Citizens United v.

Rather than acting truly independently of campaigns, as the majority of justices envisioned, these entities exclusively act on behalf of individual candidates <U+2014> and are typically run by former aides.

John E. Brennan had the option Wednesday morning of entering Multnomah County Circuit Court's community court program, which would allow his misdemeanor to be treated like a citation. He would be required to plead guilty. He also likely would be ordered to do community service and write an apology letter. But Brennan and his attorney, Michael E. Rose, told a judge that they wanted to go to trial.
Doolittle's mission has been credited with boosting American morale following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. But it did not come without a price.
Departments have sometimes changed their mind on which segments to include in their measurements. In Los Angeles, as the city government was considering cutting the fire department's budget, the fire department reported it was meeting NFPA standards on about 80% of calls<U+2014>not quite as many as NFPA guidelines suggest, but enough for the city council to approve budget cuts. Since then, the department has seen its performance drop markedly, so that it is getting to fires in time just about 60% of the time.

The drum set at Omega Music, a Granite City music store, has volume control. It's probably a good idea, given many of the musicians laying down the beats on the instrument are in grade school.
Prepayment penalties are banned in 10 states, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. They're legal in California. That's one of several reasons companies like Quick Loan thrive here.

Excavated material will be transported and disposed of at the Maryland Port Administration's Cox Creek Disposal site in Anne Arundel County, the MDTA said.
You don't want to overreact to the rudeness, because doing so might actually reinforce the behavior, by providing the spotlight the kid's trying to hog. A flat, "Not while mommy's talking" or "It's Jimmy's turn to talk" or even "Please don't interrupt," followed by returning your attention to whomever is talking, teaches your child that this ploy won't work.
I go to public school, meaning my education is supposedly free. But I understand that my parents and I need to occasionally kick in some money for supplies. My school isn't exactly rich, but the cost of getting into a good college is getting to be a bit much. Senior year is supposedly more expensive, and then after that, there's college to pay for.

The mayor brought his own version of the agreement for the council to sign, calling his proposal a "team-building" document that was more "inclusive." Kight's version asked the councilors as well as the mayor to communicate about their work on city affairs and agree to the same conditions for the reimbursement of expenses. His proposal also cut out parts of the councilors' proposed agreement, such as a provision that asked him to limit his time at City Hall.
Muslims pray five times a day, and literally thousands upon thousands of people showed up for every single prayer there. To see so many worshipers rushing toward the mosque after hearing the "adhaan" called was nothing like I'd ever witnessed before. It was truly spiritually uplifting. Even shopkeepers closed their shops during prayers, believing the reward for praying at Masjid al-Nabawi is equivalent to the reward of praying 1,000 prayers in almost any other mosque.
"The concern I hear most often is that there are not enough staff to have checks and balances," she said.

What happened next helped establish Aldridge as one of the league<U+2019>s premier power forwards. In the fourth quarter Aldridge scored 20 points, including 10 in a row, as the Blazers came back from a 17-point deficit. But it was more how he was scoring than how much he was scoring. Aldridge was battling inside, using post moves and contact rather than relying on his jumper.
<U+0093>It makes me feel good,<U+0094> said Denby junior class president Kevin Adolph, 17. <U+0093>We<U+0092>re cleaning up the community.<U+0094>
2007-08: What if Eric Gordon, Rivals.com's No. 2 recruit, didn't hold the program hostage? What if Indiana's Kelvin Sampson didn't pull the robbery like Vinny from "Jersey Shore"? What-if Weber sensed Gordon waffling and signed Evan Turner or E'Twaun Moore as insurance? What if Shaun Pruitt didn't poison the locker room? What if Weber watched Smith and Gordon, potential All-Big Ten shooting guards, rain 3s like an orange-and-blue bomb squad?

"It's not too far reaching, and it does provide a good tool for parents and students of college-bound people to get a sense of what their bottom-line cost will be," said Daniel Lugo, head of financial aid at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania.
Violin playing could be heard through the open windows of the conservatory, where guides showed the patrons portraits and archives of various musicians, an impressive collection of antique and often unusual instruments (including what looked like a long wooden table that was a harpsichord on one end and a piano on the other) and oddities such as a chair in which German composer Richard Wagner was said to have sat.
In 1999, the party fell below 50 percent of all county voters for the first time since 1984. In 2001, it lost its spot as the California county with the highest percentage of GOP voters. By 2007, it ranked ninth among the 58 counties.
Some digital stations that had been coming in well may go blank, and your converter box or TV will tell you you're not receiving a signal. Don't panic. That likely means that the station has switched to a new digital frequency. Locally, you can expect a change in WJW Channel 8 and WKYC Channel 3. In order to get those stations back you need to "re-scan" or "auto program" your TV or converter box to find the channels on their new frequencies. For good measure, you should re-scan one last time over the weekend to make sure you pick up any channels that might switch their frequency later in the day on Friday.

Mohamed Mohamud, 20, a former Oregon State University student who went to high school in Beaverton, is accused of trying to ignite a weapon of mass destruction at Portland<U+2019>s annual tree lighting last Nov. 26. He dialed a cellphone to set off the bomb on a street next to Pioneer Courthouse Square, prosecutors say. But the explosive was a dummy bomb rigged by the FBI. The inert bomb was part of an elaborate sting by two undercover FBI operatives who had spent months posing as Islamic terrorists.

"He's pretty flexible on the offensive side," Elway said of Manning. "Obviously, when you think about a Peyton Manning, one of the things you get is not only great physical attributes, but the mind that he can bring to the game.

When Obama came into office, he had a choice: Clear the decks and work on jobs and the economy, or stick with his original program of legislative bloat. He chose No. 2, and on present evidence, it was too much for American business to absorb so soon after a major credit crisis.
Knapp's new home of Highland Park might look familiar to sharp-eyed Cupertino residents. The suburban city of roughly 33,000 residents is located about 23 miles north of downtown Chicago and served as the backdrop for several movies written and directed by John Hughes in the 1980s, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Weird Science and Sixteen Candles.

Ohio State's 98-66 win over the Patriots this evening in front of the home crowd wasn't just a demolition derby on the hardwood, it was a Mr. Universe contest where the Buckeyes flexed the biggest muscle. It wasn't a convincing win, it was a pulverization of the weak.

Ornstein, a political scientist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Indiana's Senate race could be a test case for which group holds more sway with Republican voters.
Sarah, 20, Santa Clara: If the guy asks you to prom (versus arranging to go as friends) he usually pays. If you feel uncomfortable with that, offer to pay for dinner. Whether he treats or not, unless it's a "friend date," spend most of your time with him. Don't fast dance with the same other guy more than twice, and only slow dance once with someone else. To exceed this is being totally rude.

In last season's BCS National Championship game, the Ducks started Houston product Darron Thomas at quarterback and Texarkana's LaMichael James at running back.
"We had a horrible defensive inning and it cost us," East coach Natalie Peters said. "This was one of the best games that Alison Mitts has pitched, but we just didn't play any defense behind her. That's the story of our season, giving up a bunch of unearned runs, and it's hard to play when you're in a hole all the time."

PSU, meanwhile, would trade 31,000 square feet that it rents for $497,000 a year for 35,000 square feet at $959,000 -- though PSU officials note that they would gain research space, a 350-student lecture hall and, they expect, millions of dollars in grants.

Through a spokeswoman, he said he supports White's decision to proceed with the reenactment. "The leaders in my administration will always take the actions necessary to make the right decisions, not just the most expedient decisions."
Whether they will escape their fate is the question, that they will fall in love is a given. Though time is spent on the budding romance, most of the sparks fly as the two run the various mazes the filmmaker has constructed. As always there are complicating factors and other players, the central ones here are Mitchel's sister, Briony (Anna Friel, lovely as a lush who needs looking after), and Charlotte's best friend, Jordan, played by David Thewlis ("Harry Potter's" Professor Lupin), quite wonderful as he goes from cowardly lion soft to sardonic steel.
At one time, a collection upwards of $150 was a huge deal. But as the tradition has matured, the contributions have grown. Karen Carter said the plays now bring in $800 to $1,200 a year. And some years, the cast has even put on two shows to meet the demand (the basement seats 25 to 30, with overflow and staircase-wary theatergoers seated upstairs for live broadcasts over the TV).
Republicans and Democrats over the next two weeks will make closed-door pitches to Rosenthal, who wants to get the two parties to agree on a map. If that fails, he will make the final decision, which is due April 3.

Apple would have plenty of room to expand on its 160 acre site -- Google occupies just 37 acres in The Dalles -- but it's not clear whether the company would have the need or ability to expand.
In an open letter released Monday, Fuller said he's never felt so "invalidated and unaccepted" as he did when he heard that news last week. He said he and his family were asking the school to reverse its decision, and he launched an online petition Monday that was signed by hundreds of supporters within its first hours.
"I'd like to thank USA Gymnastics and especially Peter Vidmar for standing by your word about making 'immediate' changes to your by-laws regarding banned coaches," Julie Whitman, a former U.S. junior national team and Flairs gymnast who said she was physically abused by Boger, said in an email to The Register. "My goal coming forward almost four years ago was to try to protect young gymnasts from the pain my teammates and I went suffered many years ago... I hope more sports follow suit and institute new policies of their own to protect young athletes. I understand winning is important (but) we need to stop turning a blind eye to these abusive coaches and focus on protecting young boys and girls."
But that, too, signals trouble. Plugging a pothole in a decayed road is like putting a filling in a rotten tooth, said Drummond Kahn, director of Portland's Audit Services Division.
Pundits were quick to opine that Santorum has no real shot at the nomination. His campaign is too underfunded, he<U+2019>s <U+201C>outside the mainstream<U+201D> on such social issues as gay rights and abortion, he lacks the organization to dent Romney in New Hampshire, etc.
Friday's report from the National Transportation Safety Board also determined that Hatch, 46, failed to follow the proper protocol after the first attempt at landing his single-engine plane failed. That contributed to the crash, the report said.

"I didn't know what to expect because I never ran something like that," Chandler said. "I didn't know how to run it, so I went out there and basically just ran. ... We kept sticking to it and over time progressively got faster, but I didn't know what I was getting myself into. It's probably the most painful race that I've run in my life."
If JoePa, who at 84 is little more than a figurehead anyway when it comes to on-the-field coaching, won't resign, the school needs to fire him. Immediately.
Wind and solar won't do, at least not until large-scale electricity storage technology is developed, because the city must buy power that won't be interrupted when the sun sets or the wind stops blowing.
All of which helps explain why, on the hottest Saturday night of the year, Armisen and Brownstein are at In Other Words, the bookstore on Northeast Killingsworth Street where "Portlandia" sketches featuring Brownstein and Armisen as self-righteously feminist clerks at the Women & Women First bookstore are filmed. The real In Other Words, founded in 1993 as a feminist bookstore, is a more welcoming place. The nonprofit has recently been expanding its focus to become not just a bookstore but also a feminist community center.
Construction cranes sprout from the campus of UC San Diego like so many towering palm trees.
The bundling of Barnes & Noble's college business into NewCo indicates a hope that a fair few of these customers will be students. Allen Weiner of Gartner, another research firm, suggests that through campus bookshops Barnes & Noble could sell Windows devices preloaded with course material.
Many of Warhol's films are rarely screened, for reasons that would strike most observers as obvious. As the artist no doubt knew, it would be masochistic to sit through all eight hours of "Empire," a single-shot portrait of the Empire State Building at night in which pretty much nothing happens.
Thus, Ronny's dilemma. To tell Nick, how to tell Nick, when to tell Nick that won't mess up their deadline with Chrysler. Or to confront Geneva. Or ask Beth for advice. What's the "guy code" in a situation like this?
In response to the shooting spree, the neighborhood around the school was sealed off for five hours.

<U+2014> ARAB SPRING: It began with demonstrations in Tunisia that rapidly toppled the longtime strongman. Spreading like a wildfire, the Arab Spring protests sparked a revolution in Egypt that ousted Hosni Mubarak, fueled a civil war in Libya that climaxed with Moammar Gadhafi's death, and fomented a bloody uprising in Syria against the Assad regime. Bahrain and Yemen also experienced major protests and unrest.

Nor does the Constitution fix the membership of the House of Representatives at 435. The Constitution says you can have one representative for every 30,000 constituents. Given Congress' low approval rating, the idea of making it bigger might seem insane, though one could argue that one person representing 700,000 people <U+0096> the current ratio <U+0096> is equally insane.

different. Is s this a power that you think the governor of any state should have? If a murderer is sentenced to life in prison, or a certain number of years, should a governor be able to overrule a judge and jury?
Voters also should be aware that this is not the only tax increase flying at their heads. Gov. Jerry Brown is seeking a $9 billion state tax increase. President Obama wants to suspend some of the Bush tax cuts. On Jan. 1, Mr. Obama's payroll tax cut might be ended. And tax increases from Obamacare would kick in, assuming the program survives U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny.

But as Larsson's readers know, appearances can be deceiving. Moviegoers who bought $226 million worth of tickets worldwide for the Hollywood big-screen version of Larsson's first novel, "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," couldn't agree more. Stockholm, in Larsson's vision, is a dystopia of conspiracy, betrayal, misogyny, murder and revenge. With another Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara pulse-pounder due in 2013, exploring Stockholm now amounts to a 3-D, real-time preview, with aquavit and reindeer sausage in place of Pepsi and buttered popcorn.

Johnson's life as a sari-draped nun, when she was known as Sister Donata, was troubled from almost the start. Although she relished her early years in the convent as she worked with children in poverty-stricken American neighborhoods, her superiors recognized her intelligence and put her on a managerial fast-track in the ultra-regimented, secretive Missionaries of Charities order. Far from tending to Calcutta's poor, Johnson spent most of her years as a nun in and around Rome studying, teaching, writing theological curricula and doing paperwork.

Cost tops the list of what motivates light-rail opponents. Original CRC estimates for light rail were $1.17 billion, but the project's costs are fluid because of uncertainty about the bridge design and unknowns associated with acquiring land.

A C-Tran measure seeking a bump in the sales tax for light-rail maintenance might end up on the 2012 ballot.

Closer to Princeville, 'Anini Beach Park generally offers calm waters even when big surf is pounding the rest of the North Shore, thanks to a 2-mile-long fringing reef.

Yes, for years, the Democratic Party was its own worst enemy, often unloading its fiercest ammo into its own feet. Or in circular formation. (Remember the last presidential election <U+2014> when the party hacks wanted to nullify the primary votes of every single Democrat in Florida?)
There is certainly a challenge in keeping up with the competition. Patel notes that location matters -- since there are so many options, customers tend to be faithful to the yogurt shop nearest to them.

Pole position: Danielle and her friends go to Squeeze Lounge for some stripper pole lessons: "Since Steve, I've had problems feeling comfortable with any part of my body at all." Really? Hustler has evidence to the contrary. Danny Provenzano happens to be there as well; he's apparently joined the "crusade" to get Danielle back onto the dating scene. We're sure he has a few friends who are Danielle's speed. Kim takes the first crack at the stripper pole. She's in pretty good shape, but straddling a stripper pole in black booty shorts and knee-high boots is not a good look for her. And mind you, she has a 20-something son who is undoubtedly watching ... and cringing. Cue the sexy saxophone music, it's Danielle's turn. She humps the pole, shakes her tush at the boys, and does a split, and the next thing you know, Danielle's got her groove back. "This what worked for the father of my children. You saw my house, right?"

It all seems so obvious, doesn't it? But when you're bedazzled by the exotic, overconfident in your abilities or underprepared for wilderness, your vacation can end sooner than you think. As a Californian, I appreciate the advice of Denis Scott, who relocated to Oahu some years back: "Hawaii is an amazing place to visit...but it is a different place. It is its own place<U+2014>culture, land, ocean, etc. Come to learn and experience. And by learn, sometimes that means watch or enjoy, not do or hop in."

Sprint customers in many states apparently already pay taxes on out-of-state calls, making a change to their bills unlikely. States with laws more similar to New York's, however, might be inclined to check Sprint's methods in pursuit of added state revenues.

More adventurous palates should try Sung's favorite: a pretzel stuffed with red bean and cheese, the most lunatic of the stuffed pretzel fillings.

The experience is balanced right on the slightly bewildering, charming knife's edge between a sweet and a savory snack <U+2014> an Asian dessert that wandered into a calzone.

Do read: Nina Easton's Fortune magazine profile of Bill Daley, officially Obama's chief of staff and unofficially his ambassador to corporate America. The son and brother of former Chicago mayors, Daley made his first visit to Oval Office when he was 12 -- after John F. Kennedy's inauguration. Daley's coziness with Wall Street -- he ran J.P. Morgan's Midwest operations and sat on the bank's executive committee before coming to the White House -- and his criticism of last year's health reform bill (also before he went to work for the president, of course) don't sit well with the Democratic Left. But Obama's never had many personal ties to top corporate leaders -- which can exacerbate policy differences. Daley can help with that.

Another time, right after we sat down, we asked for the four spreads ($16) -- a delicious cucumber yogurt, whipped feta with fire-roasted chiles, mesquite grilled eggplant and mullet roe -- to enjoy with cocktails. We suspected something was amiss when we waited 15 minutes, then saw another group get our order, to their surprise and delight.

How about those of us who have retired and have a small portfolio of blue chip stocks whose dividends augment Social Security?

I do not follow college or professional sports; however, I am aware of certain coaches and players that have become icons in our world. Joe Paterno was synonymous with Penn State. To many he represented college athletics at its pinnacle. The playing of a sport is often used as a metaphor for life <U+2014> its joy and its vicissitudes. Young people look up and revere their coaches. The fact that Mr. Paterno heard a report of a child being sexually molested and told this to his superiors but did not follow through is an egregious act on his part. Mr. Paterno has had a long and illustrious run with Penn State football, but in my mind all this pales in the face of his "sin of omission." His lack of integrity is what will always stand, not his heroic football record.

Behold, the latest micro-trend story that's not really a trend because no one you know is actually foolish enough to try it, all about how some otherwise healthy but still desperately inept women are paying large amounts of money to have a doctor insert a feeding tube up their noses, down their throats and into their stomachs. For multiple days at a time. By choice.

The iconic 72 stone steps leading to the entrance of the latter location are often referred to as the "Rocky Steps"; making the trip up them is regarded as a symbol of perseverance and determination. A larger-than-life bronze Rocky Balboa statue, located at the bottom of the stairs, was originally created for "Rocky III," from 1982. Today, the statue of the boxer offers a popular photo spot for visitors.
Both Jewish and victims' groups responded that it was inappropriate to compare the discomfort being experienced by the church leadership in the sex abuse scandal to the violence that culminated in the Holocaust.

Just because your drug of choice is a man (or gambling or risky sex or compulsive shopping or overeating or dieting/exercising or ... ) instead of a mind-altering chemical, that doesn't make your position harmless, and it certainly doesn't make it romantic. It's bad for you. You don't care. Why?

Still, in many cities, Eid observances are easy to spot. Muslims don their best clothes, from traditional ethnic garb to three-piece suits, and fill mosques and rented ballrooms beyond capacity.

Frost worked with his colleagues to bring about voting reforms and organizational changes to the agency.

6. The Newton Boys (1998) Willis Newton: Not many people saw this Richard Linklater film about four brothers who decide farming in the 1920s Depression was not near as profitable as robbing banks. McConaughey is the oldest, with Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio and Skeet Ulrich as the siblings.
Expect Thomas to play, probably a lot. The 5-foot-9, 173-pound, five-star recruit from Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, saw snaps at running back and slot receiver last week against the Tigers. He was part of the game plan even before the Ducks were short-handed.

The next morning, it's a 4-mile, 45-minute ride, with a couple of birding detours, along the rutted road to the 800-acre Pinca Paniagua, another remote site on the bird route. The working cattle farm is situated amid undisturbed forests, evidenced by the barks of howler monkeys vying with bawling cows. Owner Oscar Paniagua, whose father settled the property 50 years ago, takes us on a long, hot hike across his red-clay land. Like other landowners who have joined the bird route, he has ambitious plans that involve construction of an eco-lodge that would dish up food produced on his farm. After heartfelt goodbyes and good lucks, we are on the road again, headed to Selva Verde Lodge.
5. Love for Love but not for loss: The crowd at the Target Center broke into a chant of "M-V-P! M-V-P!" for Kevin Love as he shot free throws during the Timberwolves' loss to Dallas on Monday. Guess "Most Improved" doesn't really roll off the tongue.

A: Has any watering been changed in your backyard? Most homeowners don't realize they need to update and evaluate their drip irrigation every other year. Plants grow and change. Tree canopies enlarge, and the drip needs to enlarge with them.

The Admiral left the St. Louis riverfront for the last time on July 19. The boat had been a St. Louis fixture since 1940, when the owner, Streckfus Steamers, completed the boat's sleek, million-dollar Art Deco skin. Hull weakness discovered by the Coast Guard in 1979 ended the Admiral's cruising days. Streckfus sold the Admiral to a Pittsburgh businessman who removed its diesel engines and announced a plan to move the boat there. He later sold it to interests in St. Louis, where it reopened in 1987 as an entertainment center managed by Six Flags. It flopped.
That buyer's market allowed Andrew Gonzales, a 24-year-old police officer in Santa Fe, N.M., to be picky about price when looking for a home for himself and his three-year-old daughter. He closed last month on a $132,000, three-bedroom home in Rio Rancho, a suburb of Albuquerque, after the price was cut twice. Just before closing, the home was appraised for $18,000 higher than the sales price, at $150,000, by a private appraiser.

16. Illinois (6-0)
Bernanke also expressed concerns about millions who have been out of work for more than six months. Those long-term unemployed Americans have made up more than 40 percent of the unemployed since December, he said. In the severe 1981-82 recession, long-term unemployment never exceeded 25 percent.
Leshoure is one of three Lions from their 2011 draft class cited for marijuana-related offenses this off-season.

Annakin Slayd is a sports-rapper (he also does a song about the Montreal Canadiens, which, less imaginatively, samples <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t Stop Believin<U+2019><U+2019>) who probably grew up when I did. I<U+2019>m sure he remembers the pre-ESPN era, and I imagine that his relationship to his club was mediated by the same forces that shaped mine: staticky radio, Topps picture cards, shoddily written preview issues in fly-by-night magazines, Games of the Week on television, and occasional golden trips to the ballpark. The Expos never won anything, but their near-misses <U+2013> many of which are inscribed in Slayd<U+2019>s verse <U+2013> are part of Canadian baseball lore.

"It is not possible for the editor of any news organization to authorize criminal acts," said Green, who has frequently criticized Murdoch's News Corp.
But if you want some fun for free indoors, it's possible. My first suggestion might shock you. The library is a great place for free fun (so long as you aren't late with your returns). Many teens are quick to turn their noses up at the library because reading is often thought of as work. I have been assigned my fair share of reading in school and do not always look for extra reading in my spare time. But there are plenty of great books at the library you can indulge in without having to worry about themes or symbolism. Also, literature is not the only thing the library has to offer. DVDs of movies and TV shows are also available.
China has only 53 vehicles for every 1,000 people compared with a U.S. rate of about 800 vehicles, as of 2010.
His ambitions always have been contained within the rink's walls. When Lidstrom was a child, he chose defense for two reasons: He would have more to do, and more time to do it. Defensemen play more than forwards, and they have more responsibilities. So what if they aren't usually the hero?
And Newt Gingrich? Goldring said he's a nose-to-spite-his-face Tribute. Like some of the competitors in "The Hunger Games," Gingrich is a contestant "willing to say anything rather than see either of the other <U+2026> candidates succeed."

Joyce, who earned a reputation as beyond tough during 12 years in the National Football League -- including a year with the expansion Minnesota Vikings -- might have replied that he came from an era when players gladly took on such challenges for next to nothing. In fact, he himself was the target of a small bounty in the 1950s because of his ability to single-handedly change the course of a game.

His wife's subterfuge is so good that once, after driving for five hours, White thought they were lost in Maine - until they got out of the car and into a boat for a trip across Chesuncook Lake to a bed-and-breakfast. Another time, without telling him they were going to England, she tricked him into getting a passport by having his daughter tell him that she was getting one and he should, too.

Last season: Falcons went for broke in 2011, giving up hefty package to Cleveland on draft day to land receiver Julio Jones from Alabama. He was supposed to be explosive offensive player who would carry Atlanta to Super Bowl, but season was disappointment despite fourth consecutive winning record and another trip to playoffs. Falcons were wiped out in opening round by eventual Super Bowl champion Giants, failing to score any offensive points. Owner Arthur Blank vowed to shake things up, but Falcons largely stood pat after playoff debacle.

Eating on the run, whether it's fast food or an energy bar, can wreak havoc with your digestion and your waistline, so be kind to yourself and follow these suggestions: Save half of your order and take it home for later.

Watch out for hidden calories in condiments, dressings, sauces, and toppings. Do a little research online and know what you are putting in your mouth. A big bowl of soup for dinner is filling, and you won't eat as much high-calorie food. Instead of supersizing, get the kid size or an appetizer. Whatever you eat should make you feel good, not sick.

Offshore wind power could cost up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour under the governor's bill, roughly double what Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. customers now pay for power produced largely by burning coal.

Michael Fleming is a Raleigh, N.C.-based "mercury-free" dentist who hasn't used amalgam in his practice for 28 years. He never guarantees that removing amalgam will improve health and advises of potential drawbacks: tooth sensitivity, potential future need of a root canal if there's nerve damage in the process, the increased release of mercury vapors during removal and the cost, which can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. He typically doesn't recommend it for very ill people or those with life-threatening medical conditions.

she said. "But I guess I'm a little bored with how I've been dressing." She said she was in a rut of beiges and brown. She needs orthotics, so her typical footwear is bland walking sneakers. Yet Gloria made it clear that she doesn't like "frills" or the idea that women are 'supposed" to dress in some hyper-feminine way.

Each of these works reflects a profound knowledge of Scripture and tradition on the part of the writer, the kind of knowledge found only among those who take them seriously enough to probe the deepest questions in their terms. These texts are not allegories, because in each case the writer has posed a problem within a universe of thought that is fully open to his questioning once its terms are granted. Here the use of biblical allusion is not symbolism or metaphor, which are both rhetorical techniques for enriching a narrative whose primary interest does not rest with the larger resonances of the Bible. In fact these great texts resemble Socratic dialogues in that each venture presupposes that meaning can indeed be addressed within the constraints of the form and in its language, while the meaning to be discovered through this argument cannot be presupposed. Like paintings, they render meaning as beauty.

Finally, the justice makes the case that some prisoners were sentenced to the death penalty before life without parole was available, and that if the life-without-parole sentence had been available, they might not have been given the death penalty. These prisoners were sentenced in accordance with the law in effect on the day they committed their offenses. That is the law under which they took the risk. But even if we wished to address this issue, Justice Pfeifer doesn't offer an alternative, other than to simply abolish the death penalty across the board. He appears to be in such a rush to get rid of the death penalty that he doesn't even pause to consider whether there might be another way to address this issue.

However, it can be dangerous for a dog to dart out of the house because it can be hit by a car. Also, an owner may not be physically capable of trotting to keep up with their dog's pace.

When walking and the dog is pulling on the leash the owner may simply stop walking until the dog looks back at them or slows down its pace then continue walking. In these ways we are rewarding behaviors that are more suitable to our lumbering species.

Parents start their children's involvement in the sport early, not to foster inter-school rivalries or some sense of personal ambition but because lacrosse, and sports in general, provide a unique opportunity to teach our children lessons that go well beyond the classroom or dinner table.

Individual campuses already make many decisions about course offerings, private fundraising and so forth. There might be additional ways in which more autonomy would be helpful, but the report falls short of making a good argument for its key proposal.

Some people seem to think that's the case. Me, I'm inclined to believe Gary Campbell (who knows more than all of us) when he says that it wasn't about weight gain or weight loss, it was about James spending too much time in the backfield trying to read stuff and hesitating, as opposed to following his instincts.

7. Easy does it: You've trained for months for this moment. You will find yourself at the starting line among thousands of runners with crowds cheering, music blaring, adrenaline pumping. The overwhelming urge will be to take off at the start. Don't even think about it. Rein yourself in. You will see plenty of fools passing you in dash mode at the start. Don't worry, you will see them again later . . . when you pass them. They will be the ones walking and weeping. And be realistic about where you line up for the start.

Also, that ghost of 2007? You know, taking Greg Oden instead of now MVP-candidate Kevin Durant? That's been partially exorcised, too. No, it doesn't appear Oden will play this year, probably bringing to an end a monumental No. 1-pick nightmare for Portland, but at least the Blazers appear to finally be equipped with the right personnel and depth to control the phenom.

Brian and Joe are bricklayin' masons. They're also artists, which is not an easy thing to be when you're handling 25-pound chunks of precast and sandblasted concrete.

There's no question payroll taxes are constitutional, because there's no doubt that the federal government can tax people in order to finance particular public benefits. But requiring citizens to buy something from a private company is different because private companies aren't directly accountable to the public.

But it would have been nice if they could have left natural growth near the water and built a catch basin for the runoff. ... They had a chance here to do something really special, and we didn't get the message to them, obviously."

Modern toll plazas should be placed on heavily traveled roadways into or out of desirable destinations. Such a model is used on the highways of Philadelphia, New York and Boston. This successfully employed principle suggests that the strongest commercial and residential markets should shoulder the burden of paying for infrastructure. In fact, most major cities have tolls, particularly where interstate travel is involved.

For me, it was to use that platform to share my story and to give back. And ultimately, I<U+0092>m full of peace. I<U+0092>m full of joy.<U+0094>
<U+201C>It<U+2019>s really sad,<U+201D> Bergin said. <U+201C>This has been going on for three years.<U+201D>

"It's not an indiscretion," Adams said. "It's a violation of the law."
Can you live with uncertainty? Can you delay gratification? Are you persistent? Can you bounce back after disappointment? Can you find creative solutions to problems? Are you in good health? Starting your own business is, quite literally, not for the weak of heart. Entrepreneurs need stamina to persevere in the face of the setbacks and failures they will inevitably face. Be honest about your desire to live the life of a not-yet-successful businessperson.
The current pace of 11,000 homes this year could slow because of a tighter supply of suitable home sites and as builders limit their sales because of shortages of subcontractors, said Burger.
While Obama is leading a charm offensive, his Republican critics are in a knife fight. The GOP presidential sweepstakes is a cacophony of bureaucratese, shameless pandering and transparent spinning. Last Wednesday, at the 20th televised debate of the nominating contest, the remaining contestants continued tearing each other to slivers. Their bickering is producing enough sound bites for an entire You Tube channel. It's the GOP gone wild.
What high school sports mean to me: I love high school sports. The team camaraderie, you can't beat it. Just the competitiveness of it. I can't find it in other places that I enjoy.
"Dylan has come in ready to go this year," Adam said. "That's paid off for him. He's 3-0 and his ERA is dropping. The thing is, Dylan's really worked hard to get where he's at this season. All of his pitches (fastball, curve, and change-up) all find the strike zone. Anybody that can throw three pitches for strikes is going to be effective. You don't have to blow it up there at 90 miles per hour."
The East-West Gateway Council of Governments will consider endorsing the Bike Plan later this month.

A mirror ball complemented the dreamlike qualities of <U+0093>Mexico<U+0094> and a handful of other serene selections. The only other stage prop was a redbud tree that was awarded to a fan after an extraordinarily odd exchange. Cake doesn't need special effects. When he wasn't offering droll banter, front man John McCrea acted as a frantic band director and vibra-slap fiend. Cake's prominent use of the percussive instrument is akin to Blue Oyster Cult's association with the cowbell. The noirish textures and funk flavors played by guitarist Xan McCurdy and the fastidious contributions of trumpeter and keyboardist Vince DiFiore are also essential elements of Cake's distinctive sound.

A Bel Ridge officer saw the 1995 Oldsmobile Aurora driving with expired license plates. He stopped the car on northbound Natural Bridge entrance ramp to I-170, Brock said.
The results must be filtered a bit, too. The Cardinals played in the Super Bowl the previous season, meaning their selections came near the bottom of every round. That's an obvious disadvantage.
The L.A. Phil hired the young Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel to be its music director starting in 2009, broadened its musical offerings at Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Bowl.

EUGENE -- When the Oregon baseball team faced Brigham Young on March 11 at PK Park, junior second baseman Danny Pulfer wasn't in the Ducks' starting lineup.
If enacted into law as expected, the credit card industry would have nine months to change the way it does business: Lenders would have to post their credit card agreements on the Internet and let customers pay their bills online or by phone without an added fee. They'd also have to give consumers a chance to spare themselves from over-the-limit fees and provide 45 days notice and an explanation before interest rates are increased.

The International was without question one of the two or three best golf events in the whole country.

California voters will be getting a breather on June 5, with just two state propositions on the ballot, on term limits and a tobacco tax. Each fits the reasonable standard for an initiative: It's an issue the Legislature either cannot or will not address, and neither adds a burden to the general fund.
"They are the ones who apply federal immigration law," Bender said. "If they take the position that Arizona law interferes with the operation of federal immigration, I would think that should be very persuasive with the judge." Bender said lawsuits filed against state and local governments by the federal government are not unusual but are more common in cases of civil rights issues than immigration. The U.S. Supreme Court, at the request of the U.S. solicitor general, last month agreed to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Arizona's 2007 law that penalizes employers for hiring illegal immigrants. That law has been upheld in U.S. District Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Word of Tuesday's lawsuit brought out politicians and activists to condemn and praise the federal government's action.

Lauderback encouraged the council to support hiring a professional consultant to campaign for a measure on the November ballot for a new tax.

C.B.'s spiritual and sexual journey forms the spine of the show and Linebarger gives us a deeply felt, emotionally honest portrait of a kid who's figuring out how he feels and why. His relationship with Beethoven (an equally strong performance from Newman) drives the story after a certain point and the emotional impact is considerable.
A: It focuses on female empowerment, letting these girls know there are brighter futures ahead for them. We know that a lot of them come from backgrounds where they've faced disappointment in the past. Sometimes they don't have these experiences available to them; this is something they can do, they can work with an older mentor who can share their life experience with them, experience an activity - something they might not have been able to do on their own.

As much as I like Artisan, I am won over by Villa Creek. The combinations are precocious and explosive, such as the local sea bass with a preserved lemon and red onion cr<U+00E8>me fra<U+00EE>che. The shepherd's plate of local cheese and olives arrives with a twist of preserved lemon. By the time the lamb shank is served with perfectly saut<U+00E9>ed greens and<U+2014>more lemon here<U+2014>a lovely gremolata, I should be tired of the flavor, but no, it's that smartly done.

Bryan Huffman described, for example, receiving a $100,000 check from 101-year-old heiress Rachel "Bunny" Mellon with "Antique Charleston Table" written in the memo line.

Gingrich had to leave New Hampshire on Wednesday and race to Virginia, where he needed 10,000 valid voters' signatures to secure a spot on the ballot.
The result is unfailingly delicious. Partly, of course, that's because of the butter, almost a whole stick <U+2014> how could you go wrong? But mainly, it's the slow stewing of the vegetables that results in a mellow harmony of flavors. Those whole unpeeled garlic cloves soften and release their perfume without a hint of harshness. Most times the only moisture added is from the greens as they warm.

Jaber has researched the history and geography of Mount Umunhum and the Almaden Air Force Station since 2006. In 1957, the Air Force opened a radar station on the second highest peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Up to 120 members and their families lived there at one time. It is now a ghost town, but the radar station still stands and can be seen on top of the mountain. The Mid Peninsula Open Space, once the site is cleared, plans to open it to the public with hiking trails and vista views. Jaber's unprecedented photo documentary work of the entire site has proven invaluable to preserving the history and memories of Almaden Air Force Station. For more information about the meeting, call 320-9587.

Thunder center Kendrick Perkins: <U+201C>I think we can just build off of this and keep going. But I<U+2019>m pretty satisfied with the win and how we did it. We needed one of these grind-out type of games in this type of atmosphere against a tough team like Portland.<U+201D>

More common are those cases when external political events sharply shift the political narrative, such as the ouster of the Spanish government in the aftermath of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The events of September 11th also had a major impact on the subsequent Australian election, as did a concurrent immigration controversy. Realistically, this type of shock is McCain's last hope, yet the rush to early voting has also blunted the possible impact of any last minute shock.
After the teams submit formal proposals, the advisory group will pick their best pick for the coliseum. Again, the city council has final say.
I was used to that. I had heard waves in the darkness for more than two decades of trips. But this was different. With each unseen crash of surf, the house vibrated with force of water on land. I turned on the TV and flipped through the local newscasts, with the anchors in aloha shirts talking in grave tones about the coming storm. Just before midnight, there was a knock on the door.
No surprise here that I think Obama's right about why we need to start dealing with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States today, not to mention the thousands more who want to come here tomorrow. But I doubt any amount of data about how immigrants contribute, say, to the economy will win over skeptics. Facts about why we should create a new immigration system have been out there since before Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, tried to overhaul the system.
The plans must be approved by the city of St. Louis' Cultural Resources Office, the St. Louis Community Development Agency and the Missouri State Historic Preservation Office.

I sure hope women don't let people like Mr. Limbaugh suppress their lives and those of their daughters. He's the ignorant one to think it's all about sex. But then again maybe we should just keep this a secret about how women really want to empower themselves.
The interview came on a day when the president of The Second Mile resigned. Jack Raykovitz, a practicing psychologist who had led the group for 28 years, said he hoped his departure would help restore faith in the group's mission.

He needs a job. And when he gets one, likely at that lower rank, he will occupy the slot that might have been taken by, for instance, one of his former employees, who might in turn take the lower-paid slot of someone another step down the economic ladder. And so on, in a chain reaction of downward mobility.
Ting and 10 other international researchers gathered feces of drills in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko Coastal forests that stretch across Nigeria, Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea) and Cameroon, and extracted DNA.

If Democrats wrest control of the Legislature, they'll aim squarely at raising taxes on the wealthy as a way to help plug the state's perpetual money gap and fund schools, health care and services for the poor. Should Republicans retain control, the state could see another epic clash between a GOP legislature and DFL Gov. Mark Dayton on state spending, union power and government services.

The Catholic Church, which views sex and procreation as inextricably intertwined, forbids both elective sterilization and any effort to prevent conception other than refraining from sexual contact. In response to a request by the U.S. Catholic bishops and some other religious groups that regard artificial contraception as immoral, Health and Human Services carved out a religious exemption for employers. But it was the narrowest possible exemption, covering only employers representing organizations whose primary mission is instructing members in their faith and that serve and employ mostly members of their own faith. In short, Catholic parish churches would qualify for the exemption. Catholic schools, colleges, hospitals, charities and social service agencies <U+2014> all of which minister to all comers without regard to their religious affiliation <U+2014> would not.

* In losing the first three games of the conference semifinals, the Blues are also dealing with something that they haven't experienced for a long time: a draining loss of confidence. The Blues were shaken by the loss of defenseman Alex Pietrangelo late in the second period of Game 1. He's their best player. His skills are crucial to the Blues in every aspect of the game. But I was surprised by how the Blues collapsed in Game 2. Their failure to handle the Pietrangelo affair was stunning. Sure, he returned in Game 3, but by then the damage was done. The Blues' confidence was shot, and the Kings were in complete command. The Blues' customary resilience disintegrated when Petro was taken out on a dirty hit. The Kings, already confident, were absolutely emboldened by the Pietrangelo hit job and the Blues' subsequent non-response.
"They are going to call me a career politician," he said. "My response is, 'Yeah, I was in the Legislature. But when I was there, we did things.'"

She is being questioned by David Boies, one of the plaintiffs' top guns in the case, and the cross-examination is apparently going to be handled by Proposition 8's lead lawyer, Charles Cooper. Based on the past cross-examinations of the plaintiffs experts, Badgett can expect a long day on the stand today.
Still others who use Quicken or other financial management software from Intuit have had difficulty downloading their personal financial data from the credit union to their PC.
I am also glad that my family and I are Democrats. After watching various Republican debates to earn extra credit in my "AP Government and Politics" class, I have come to the conclusion that the Republican candidates have the maturity level of elementary schoolchildren. That may seem like a harsh judgment coming from somebody who doesn't know a lot about politics, but that supports my case even more.
Hillis was projected to be a middle- to late-round pick. At the NFL Combine, he checked in at 6-0 3/4 in height, and 250 pounds. At Arkansas' Pro Day, Hillis ran the 40 in 4.56 seconds and his vertical leap was measured at 35 inches.
Many congregations this Sunday will hear Luke's account of the annunciation of Mary by Gabriel. The angel Gabriel addresses Mary as the recipient of God's favor, the chosen one of God-and invites her to discern her calling. Mary is perplexed by the announcement. "How can this be?" she wonders. "Nothing will be impossible with God," the messenger reminds Mary, standing before her as she continues to ponder her calling. It is a holy moment. As Presbyterian theologian Cynthia Rigby notes, "Mary's obedience is neither optional nor forced. Mary acts freely when she offers herself as a servant of the Lord." Because of an angel, Mary embraces her calling.
That's a more upbeat tone from its previous meeting on Jan. 26. After that meeting, Fed policymakers said the rate of economic activity was "insufficient" to bring about "significant improvement" in the job market.

14. Vancouver (9) - Conceded first goal of the season - actually, they allowed three goals to San Jose and suffered first loss of the year. With the remarkable defensive run - four consecutive shutouts to start the season - now history and the offense still struggling with three goals in five games, they better hope the game against the Earthquakes isn't beginning of a new trend.

Many things in life taste like chicken. Bear meat is not one of them.
She also strictly avoids phrases like "golden ager" or "80 years young." They may be intended to flatter, but Bennett sees them as infantilizing and ageist. She approves of the matter-of-fact "old people," though dismisses "older people" as "namby-pamby." But "elder" is her default term. Though to some it connotes village or tribal societies, she points out that modern Americans routinely use it in terms like "eldercare" and "elder abuse."

My only aggravation is that 15-year-old Cheetah Boy seems to wait until the last minute every night and then throw one day's worth of clothes in the washer.

After discussion of the wage reforms, the operations committee turned its attention to transparency, with Foye acknowledging the agency had been criticized for excessive secrecy, sometimes with good reason.

"It's state law, but I feel it's unconstitutional, it's un-American," Kilbane said in an interview. "They're purging honest, hardworking people from the political process. I'm a tradesman. What kind of bias am I going to display? I work on bridges."

The idea for this major exhibit that opened Friday at the Smithsonian American Art Museum was sparked in part by talk among experts that the United States is losing its edge in innovation as other countries spend more on research, export more technology and foreign companies gain more U.S. patents. Curators pulled together artworks, inventions and scientific discoveries from the 1800s in an unusual project for the museum to show how Americans came to believe they have a "special genius" for invention.
As to (b), the question of where the Democratic response was, that's still a mystery.

The claim: Republican Sandy Adams wants to raise sales taxes to 23 percent. So says Democrat congressional incumbent Suzanne Kosmas in a TV ad. The claim is generally correct in that Adams has supported the "Fair Tax," which relies primarily on a majorly jacked-up consumption tax. But the ad leaves out all context about how the plan would also call for abolishing all sorts of other taxes.

Sadly, there will be more situations in which our officers must act to defend themselves or us. We must let them know that when they do so appropriately and according to policy, we as a city will strongly support and fight for them.

Rachel Bootsma knows that if she wants to beat the world's best swimmers, she has to get a jump on the sunrise first. It isn't easy to leave a warm bed at 6 a.m. and drive in the dark to a suburban gym. But you can't hit the snooze button if you want to make the Olympic team, which was all the motivation the Eden Prairie swimmer needed on a frosty Friday morning.
If you opt to share your experience with coworkers, it's a good idea to be prepared for a variety of reactions, Stump-Sutliff says. While some people may respond with understanding and offers of help, others may react awkwardly out of a vague uneasiness about cancer, resent that they had to take on extra duties because of your absence, ask inappropriate questions, or avoid you because they're afraid of saying the wrong thing.

Picture perfect. Have a friend, ideally someone who knows their way around a camera, take a photo of you, your kids or your family and present it in a homemade frame, Favreau suggests. To do the latter, buy an inexpensive picture frame at a thrift store or dollar store and add your personal decorating touch. For example, coat the frame with mod podge (basically watery glue) then decoupage it with loving words cut from magazines, dried flowers or pictures that reflect her interests (flowers if she's a gardener; books if she's a reader).

When one frog starts the chorus, he stimulates other males to follow and their song fills the air.
